<h2 id="EDITORS_INTRODUCTION">EDITOR’S INTRODUCTION.</h2>

<p>In some ways nothing could be a better
introduction to the “Polite Conversation”
than the account of it which Mr.
Thackeray has given in his “English
Humourists” (though under the head of
Steele, not Swift), as illustrating the
society of the period. That account is
in its way not much less of a classic
than the immortal original itself, and
it is purely delightful. But it neither
deals nor pretends to deal with the
whole of the subject. Indeed, the idea
of Swift’s character which the “Conversation”
gives does not square altogether
well with the view—true, but one-sided—which
it suited Mr. Thackeray to
take of Swift.</p>

<p>The “Conversation” appeared very<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_viii" id="Page_viii">[viii]</a></span>
late in Swift’s life, and he himself derived
no pecuniary benefit from it. He had,
with that almost careless generosity
which distinguished him side by side with
an odd kind of parsimony, given the
manuscript to a not particularly reputable
<i>protégée</i> of his, Mrs. Barber, about 1736,
and its first edition—a copy of which,
presented to me by my friend Mr. Austin
Dobson no small number of years ago,
is here reproduced—bears date 1738,
and was published in London by Motte
and Bathurst. The composition, however,
dates, as is known to a practical
certainty, many years earlier. It is
beyond any reasonable doubt identical
with the “Essay on Conversation” which
Swift noted as written or planned in
1708-10. The <i>nom de guerre</i> on the title-page
and to the introduction is Simon
Wagstaff, one of the literary family of
Staffs fathered by Swift and Steele
in “Tatler” times. The manners are
evidently those of Queen Anne’s day,
and the whole chronology of the introduction<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ix" id="Page_ix">[ix]</a></span>
(which, it will be seen, has
all Swift’s mock carefulness and exactitude)
is adjusted to the first decade of
the eighteenth century. A hundred
years later Scott (whose own evident
relish for the “Conversation” struggled
somewhat with a desire to apologise for
its coarseness to the decencies even of
his own day), hazarded the opinion that
the abundance of proverbial expressions
must be set down to the Dean’s own
fancy, not to actual truth of reporting.
It is always with great diffidence that I
venture to differ with Sir Walter; but I
think he was wrong here. One piece of
indirect evidence—the extreme energy
with which Chesterfield, at no very distant
date from the publication, but after
a lapse of fully a generation from the
probable composition of the dialogues,
inveighs against this very practice—would
seem to be sufficient to establish
its authenticity. For polite society,
where its principles are not, as they generally
are, pretty constant, is never so<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_x" id="Page_x">[x]</a></span>
bitter as against those practices which
were the mode and are now <i>démodés</i>.</p>

<p>But if anyone thinks this argument
paradoxical, there are plenty more. The
conversation of the immortal eight corresponds
exactly to that of the comedies of
the time, and the times just earlier, which
were written by the finest gentlemen. It
meets us, of course less brilliantly put, in
the “Wentworth Papers” and other
documents of the time; and its very faults
are exactly those which Steele and Addison,
like their predecessors of the other
sex in the Hotel Rambouillet sixty or
seventy years earlier, were, just when
these dialogues were written, setting
themselves to correct. We know, of
course, that Swift moved in a world of
middle and even not always upper middle
class society, as well as in the great
world; and that, perhaps, at the date of
the actual composition of this piece, he
had not reached his fullest familiarity
with the latter. But I have myself very
little doubt that the dialogues express<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xi" id="Page_xi">[xi]</a></span>
and were fully justified by the conversation
he had actually heard among the
less decorous visitors at Temple’s solemn
board, in the livelier household of Lord
Berkeley, in the circles of Ormond and
Pembroke, and during his first initiation
after 1707 in London society proper. How
far he may have subsequently polished
and altered the thing it is impossible to
say; that he had done so to some extent
is obvious from such simple matters as
the use of the word “king” instead of
“queen,” from the allusions to the
“Craftsman,” and others. I doubt
whether the picture became substantially
false till far into the reign of George II.,
if it even became so then.</p>

<p>There are those, of whom, as Mr.
Wagstaff would himself say, “I have the
honour to be one,” who put the “Polite
Conversation” in the very front rank of
Swift’s works. It is of course on a far
less ambitious scale than “Gulliver;”
it has not the youthful audacity and
towering aim of the “Tale of a Tub;”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xii" id="Page_xii">[xii]</a></span>
it lacks the practical and businesslike
cogency of the “Drapier;” the absolute
perfection and unrivalled irony of the
“Modest Proposal” and the “Argument
against abolishing Christianity.” But
what it wants in relation to each of these
masterpieces in some respects it makes
up in others; and it is distinctly the
superior of its own nearest analogue, the
“Directions to Servants.” It is never
unequal; it never flags; it never forces
the note. Nobody, if he likes it at all,
can think it too long; nobody, however
much he may like it, can fail to see that
Swift was wise not to make it longer.
One of its charms is the complete variation
between the introduction and the
dialogues themselves. The former follows
throughout, even to the rather unnecessary
striking in with literary quarrels,
the true vein of Swiftian irony, where
almost every sentence expresses the
exact contrary of the author’s real sentiments,
and where the putative writer is
made to exhibit himself as ridiculous<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xiii" id="Page_xiii">[xiii]</a></span>
while discoursing to his own complete
satisfaction. It exhibits also, although
in a minor key, the peculiar pessimism
which excites the shudders of some and
the admiration of others in the great
satires on humanity enumerated above.</p>

<p>But the dialogues themselves are quite
different. They are, with the exception
of the lighter passages in the “Journal
to Stella,” infinitely the most good-natured
things in Swift. The characters
are scarcely satirized; they are hardly
caricatured. Not one of them is made
disagreeable, not one of them offensively
ridiculous. Even poor Sir John Linger,
despite the scarce concealed scorn and
pity of his companions and the solemn
compassion of good Mr. Wagstaff, is
let off very easily. The very “scandal-mongering”
has nothing of the
ferocity of the “Plain Dealer” long
before, and the “School for Scandal”
long after it; the excellent Ladies Smart
and Answerall tear their neighbours’
characters to pieces with much relish but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xiv" id="Page_xiv">[xiv]</a></span>
with no malignity. The former, for all her
cut-and-dried phrases, is an excellently
hospitable hostess, and “her own lord”
is as different as possible from the brutal
heroes of Restoration comedy, and from
the yawning sour-blooded rakes of quality
whom a later generation of painters in
words and colours were to portray.
There is, of course, not a little which
would now be horribly coarse, but one
knows that it was not in the least so
then. And in it, as in the scandal-mongering,
there is no bad blood. Tom
and the Colonel and Lord Sparkish are
fine gentlemen with very loose-hung
tongues, and not very strait-laced consciences.
But there is nothing about
them of the inhumanity which to some
tastes spoils the heroes of Congreve and
of Vanbrugh.</p>

<p>As for “Miss,” no doubt she says some
things which it would be unpleasant to
hear one’s sister or one’s beloved say now.
But I fell in love with her when I was about
seventeen, I think; and from that day to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xv" id="Page_xv">[xv]</a></span>
this I have never wavered for one minute
in my affection for her. If she is of coarser
mould than Millamant, how infinitely
does she excel her in flesh and blood—excellent
things in woman! She is
only here—“this ‘Miss’ of our heart, this
‘Miss’ of our soul,”—here and in a letter
or two of the time. The dramatists and
the essayists and the poets made her
a baggage or a Lydia Languish, a Miss
Hoyden or a minx, when they tried her.
Hogarth was not enough of a gentleman
and Kneller not enough of a genius to
put her on canvas. When the regular
novelists began, sensibility had set its
clutch on heroines. But here she is as
Swift saw her—Swift whom every woman
whom he knew either loved or hated,
and who must, therefore, have known
something about women, for all his persistent
maltreatment of them. And here,
as I have said, the maltreatment ceases.
If the handling is not very delicate, it is
utterly true, and by no means degrading.
There is even dignity in Miss. For all her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xvi" id="Page_xvi">[xvi]</a></span>
romps, and her broad speeches, and her
more than risky repartees, she knows
perfectly well how to pull up her somewhat
unpolished admirers when they go
too far. And when at three o’clock in
the morning, with most of the winnings
in her pocket, she demurely refuses
the Colonel’s escort (indeed it might
have had its dangers), observing, “No,
Colonel, thank you; my mamma has sent
her chair and footmen,” and leaves the
room with the curtsey we can imagine,
the picture is so delightful that unholy
dreams come upon one. How agreeable
it would have been to hire the always
available villains, overcome those footmen,
put Miss in a coach and six, and
secure the services of the also always
available parson, regardless of the feelings
of my mamma and of the swords of Tom
and the Colonel, though not of Miss’s
own goodwill! For I should not envy
anyone who had tried to play otherwise
than on the square with Miss Notable.</p>

<p>For Mr. Wagstaff’s hero I have, as no<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xvii" id="Page_xvii">[xvii]</a></span>
doubt is natural, by no means as much
admiration as for his “heroin.” Mr.
Thomas Neverout is a lively youth
enough, but considerably farther from
the idea—and that not merely the modern
idea—of a gentleman, than Miss
with all her astounding licence of speech
is from the idea—and that not merely
the modern idea—of a lady. It is observable
that he seldom or never gets
the better of her except by mere coarseness,
and that he has too frequent recourse
to the expedient which even Mr.
Wagstaff had the sense to see was not a
great evidence of wit, the use of some
innuendo or other, at which she is
obliged to blush or to pretend want of
understanding. At fair weapons she
almost always puts him down. In fact, the
Colonel, though not precisely a genius,
is the better fellow of the two. I do not
know whether it was intentional or not,
but it is to be observed that my Lord
Sparkish, though quite as “smart” in
the new-old sense of which this very<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xviii" id="Page_xviii">[xviii]</a></span>
work is the <i>locus classicus</i>, as the two
commoners, is cleaner by a good deal in
his language. It is unlike Mr. Wagstaff’s
usual precision of information
that he gives us no details about Lady
Answerall. If there is any indication to
show whether she was wife or widow, I
have missed it in many readings; but I
think she, though still young, was the
eldest of the three ladies, and she certainly
was handsome. Lady Smart I take
to have been plain, from her disparaging
reference to Miss: “The girl’s well enough
if she had but another nose.” I resent this
reference to a feature which I am sure was
charming (it was probably <i>retroussé</i>; it
was certainly not aquiline); and as Lady
Smart was clearly not ill-natured, it follows
that she must have been herself
either a recognized beauty or not beautiful.
We should have had some intimation of
the former had it been the case, so I incline
to the latter. She had children, and
was evidently on the best of terms with
her husband, which is very satisfactory.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xix" id="Page_xix">[xix]</a></span></p>

<p>If it were not for Miss and the dinner—two
objects of perennial interest to all
men of spirit and taste—I am not sure
that I should not prefer the introduction
to the conversations themselves. It is
indispensable to the due understanding
of the latter, and I cannot but think that
Thackeray unjustifiably overlooked the
excuse it contains for the somewhat miscellaneous
and Gargantuan character of
the feast which excited his astonishment
and horror. But it would be delightful
in itself if we were so unfortunate as to
have lost the conversations, and, as I
have already said, its delight is of a
strangely different kind from theirs.
Although there are more magnificent
and more terrible, more poignant and
more whimsical examples of the marvellous
Swiftian irony, I do not know that
there is any more justly proportioned,
more exquisitely modulated, more illustrative
of that wonderful keeping which
is the very essence and quiddity of the
Dean’s humour.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xx" id="Page_xx">[xx]</a></span></p>

<p>Some things have been lately said,
as they are always said from time
to time, about the contrast between
the Old humour and the New. The
contrast, I venture to think, is wrongly
stated. It is not a contrast between the
old and the new, but, in the first place,
between the perennial and the temporary,
and in the second between two kinds of
humour which, to do them justice, are both
perennial enough—the humour which
is quiet, subtle, abstracted, independent
of catchwords and cant phrases, and the
humour which is broad, loud, gesticulative,
and prone to rely upon cant phrases
and catchwords. Swift has illustrated
the two in the two parts of this astonishing
book, and whoso looks into the matter
a little narrowly will have no difficulty
in finding this out. Far be it from me
to depreciate the “newer” kind, but I
may be permitted to think it the lower.
It is certainly the easier. The perpetual
stream of irony which Swift pours out
here in so quiet yet so steady a flow, is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxi" id="Page_xxi">[xxi]</a></span>
the most difficult of all things to maintain
in its perfection. Not more, perhaps,
than half-a-dozen writers in all
literature, of whom the three chiefs are
Lucian, Pascal, and Swift himself, have
been quite masters of it, and of these
three Swift is the mightiest. Sink below
the requisite proportion of bitterness and
the thing becomes flat; exceed that proportion
and it is nauseous. Perhaps,
as one is always fain to persuade oneself
in such cases, a distinct quality
of palate is required to taste, as well as
a distinct power of genius to brew it. It
is certain that though there are some in
all times who relish this kind of humour
(and this is what gives it its supremacy,
for examples of the other kind are, at
other than their own times, frequently
not relished by anybody), they are not
often found in large numbers. The
liquor is too dry for many tastes; it has
too little froth, if not too little sparkle
for others. The order of architecture is
too unadorned, depends too much upon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxii" id="Page_xxii">[xxii]</a></span>
the bare attraction of symmetry and
form, to charm some eyes. But those
who have the taste never lose it, never
change it, never are weary of gratifying
it. Of irony, as of hardly any other
thing under the sun, cometh no satiety
to the born ironist.</p>

<p>It may be well to end this brief preface
by a few words on the principles of
editing which I have adopted. There is
no omission whatever, except of a very
few words—not, I think, half a score in
all—which were barely permissible to
mouths polite even then, and which now
are almost banished from even free conversation.
Nor have even these omissions
been allowed to mutilate the passages
in which they occur; for on Mr.
Wagstaff’s own excellent principle, the
harmless necessary “blank, which the
sagacious reader may fill up in his own
mind,” has replaced them.</p>

<p>In respect of annotation the methods
of the collection in which this book appears
did not permit of any very extensive<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxiii" id="Page_xxiii">[xxiii]</a></span>
commentary; and I could not be
sorry for this. Anything like full <i>scholia</i>
on the proverbs, catchwords, and so forth
used, would be enormously voluminous,
and a very dull overlaying of matter ill-sortable
with dulness. Besides, much of
the phraseology is intelligible to anybody
intelligent, and not a very little is not
yet obsolete in the mouths of persons of
no particular originality. You may still
hear men and women, not necessarily
destitute either of birth, breeding, or
sense, say of such a thing that “they
like it, but it does not like them,” that
such another thing “comes from a hot
place,” with other innocent <i>clichés</i> of the
kind. But in some places where assistance
seemed really required I have endeavoured
to give it. Among such cases
I have not included the attempt to identify
“the D. of R.,” “the E. of E.,” “Lord
and Lady H.,” etc. I am afraid it would
be falling too much into the humour of
good Mr. Wagstaff himself to examine
with the help of much Collins the various<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxiv" id="Page_xxiv">[xxiv]</a></span>
persons whose initials and titles might
possibly correspond with these during
the nearly sixty years between Mr. Wagstaff’s
coming of age and the appearance
of his work at the Middle Temple Gate
in Fleet Street. The persons named at
full length are generally, if not universally
real, and more or less well known.
Enough to inform or remind the reader
of these has, I hope, been inserted in the
Notes. But the fact is, that, like most
great writers, though not all, Swift is
really not in need of much annotation.
It is not that he is not allusive—I hardly
know any great writer who is not—but
that his allusions explain themselves to
a reader of average intelligence quite
sufficiently for the understanding of the
context, though not, it may be, sufficiently
to enable him to “satisfy the
examiners.” It does not, for instance,
matter in the least whether the “infamous
Court chaplain,” who taught the
maids of honour not to believe in Hell
was Hoadley, or who he was. His cap<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxv" id="Page_xxv">[xxv]</a></span>
may even have fitted several persons at
different times. In such a display of
literary skill at arms as this the glitter
of the blade and the swashing blow of
its wielder are the points of interest,
not the worthless carrion into which it
was originally thrust. But “worthless
carrion” is not Polite Conversation: so
let me leave the reader to what is.<a name="FNanchor_1" id="FNanchor_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a></p>

<h2 id="AN_INTRODUCTION">AN INTRODUCTION<br />
<span class="smaller">TO THE</span><br />
FOLLOWING TREATISE.</h2>

<p>As my Life hath been chiefly spent in
consulting the Honour and Welfare of
my Country for more than Forty Years
past, not without answerable Success, if
the World and my Friends have not
flattered me; so, there is no Point
wherein I have so much labour’d, as that
of improving and polishing all Parts of
Conversation between Persons of Quality,
whether they meet by Accident or Invitation,
at Meals, Tea, or Visits, Mornings,
Noons, or Evenings.</p>

<p>I have passed perhaps more time than
any other Man of my Age and Country
in Visits and Assemblees, where the
polite Persons of both Sexes distinguish
themselves; and could not without much
Grief observe how frequently both Gentlemen
and Ladies are at a Loss for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
Questions, Answers, Replies and Rejoinders:
However, my Concern was
much abated, when I found that these
Defects were not occasion’d by any
Want of Materials, but because those
Materials were not in every Hand: For
Instance, One Lady can give an Answer
better than ask a Question: One Gentleman
is happy at a Reply; another
excels in a Rejoinder: One can revive a
languishing Conversation by a sudden
surprizing Sentence; another is more
dextrous in seconding; a Third can fill
the Gap with laughing, or commending
what hath been said: Thus fresh Hints
may be started, and the Ball of Discourse
kept up.</p>

<p>But, alas! this is too seldom the Case,
even in the most select Companies: How
often do we see at Court, at public
Visiting-Days, at great Men’s Levees,
and other Places of general Meeting,
that the Conversation falls and drops to
nothing, like a Fire without Supply of
Fuel; this is what we ought to lament;
and against this dangerous Evil I take
upon me to affirm, that I have in the
following Papers provided an infallible
Remedy.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span></p>

<p>It was in the Year 1695, and the Sixth
of his late Majesty King <i>William</i>, the
Third, of ever glorious and immortal
Memory, who rescued Three Kingdoms
from Popery and Slavery; when, being
about the Age of Six-and-thirty, my
Judgment mature, of good Reputation
in the World, and well acquainted with
the best Families in Town, I determined
to spend Five Mornings, to dine Four
times, pass Three Afternoons, and Six
Evenings every Week, in the Houses of
the most polite Families, of which I
would confine myself to Fifty; only
changing as the Masters or Ladies died,
or left the Town, or grew out of Vogue,
or sunk in their Fortunes, (which to me
was of the highest moment) or because
disaffected to the Government; which
Practice I have followed ever since to
this very Day; except when I happened
to be sick, or in the Spleen upon cloudy
Weather; and except when I entertained
Four of each Sex at my own Lodgings
once a Month, by way of Retaliation.</p>

<p>I always kept a large Table-Book in
my Pocket; and as soon as I left the
Company, I immediately entered the
choicest Expressions that passed during<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
the Visit; which, returning Home, I
transcribed in a fair Hand, but somewhat
enlarged; and had made the
greatest Part of my Collection in Twelve
Years, but not digested into any Method;
for this I found was a Work of infinite
Labour, and what required the nicest
Judgment, and consequently could not
be brought to any Degree of Perfection
in less than Sixteen Years more.</p>

<p>Herein I resolved to exceed the Advice
of <i>Horace</i>, a <i>Roman</i> Poet, (which I
have read in Mr. <i>Creech</i>’s admirable
Translation) That an Author should
keep his Works Nine Years in his Closet,
before he ventured to publish them; and
finding that I still received some additional
Flowers of Wit and Language,
although in a very small Number, I
determined to defer the Publication, to
pursue my Design, and exhaust, if possible,
the whole Subject, that I might
present a complete System to the World:
For, I am convinced by long Experience,
that the Critics will be as severe as their
old Envy against me can make them: I
foretel, they will object, that I have inserted
many Answers and Replies which
are neither witty, humorous, polite, or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
authentic; and have omitted others, that
would have been highly useful, as well as
entertaining: But let them come to Particulars,
and I will boldly engage to confute
their Malice.</p>

<p>For these last Six or Seven Years I
have not been able to add above Nine
valuable Sentences to inrich my Collection;
from whence I conclude, that what
remains will amount only to a Trifle:
However, if, after the Publication of this
Work, any Lady or Gentleman, when
they have read it, shall find the least
thing of Importance omitted, I desire
they will please to supply my Defects,
by communicating to me their Discoveries;
and their Letters may be directed
to <span class="smcap">Simon Wagstaff</span>, Esq; at
his Lodgings next Door to the <i>Gloucester-Head</i>
in <i>St. James’s-street</i>, (they paying
the Postage). In Return of which Favour,
I shall make honourable Mention
of their Names in a short Preface to the
Second Edition.</p>

<p>In the mean time, I cannot but with
some Pride, and much Pleasure, congratulate
with my dear Country, which
hath outdone all the Nations of <i>Europe</i>
in advancing the whole Art of Conversation<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
to the greatest Height it is capable
of reaching; and therefore being intirely
convinced that the Collection I now offer
to the Public is full and complete, I may
at the same time boldly affirm, that the
whole Genius, Humour, Politeness and
Eloquence of <i>England</i> are summed up in
it: Nor is the Treasure small, wherein
are to be found at least a Thousand
shining Questions, Answers, Repartees,
Replies and Rejoinders, fitted to adorn
every kind of Discourse that an Assemblee
of <i>English</i> Ladies and Gentlemen, met
together for their mutual Entertainment,
can possibly want, especially when the
several Flowers shall be set off and improved
by the Speakers, with every Circumstance
of Preface and Circumlocution,
in proper Terms; and attended
with Praise, Laughter, or Admiration.</p>

<p>There is a natural, involuntary Distortion
of the Muscles, which is the anatomical
Cause of Laughter: But there is
another Cause of Laughter which Decency
requires, and is the undoubted
Mark of a good Taste, as well as of a
polite obliging Behaviour; neither is this
to be acquired without much Observation,
long Practice, and a sound Judgment:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
I did therefore once intend, for
the Ease of the Learner, to set down in
all Parts of the following Dialogues certain
Marks, Asterisks, or <i>Nota-bene’s</i> (in
<i>English</i>, <i>Markwell’s</i>) after most Questions,
and every Reply or Answer; directing
exactly the Moment when One,
Two, or All the Company are to laugh:
But having duly considered, that the
Expedient would too much enlarge the
Bulk of the Volume, and consequently
the Price; and likewise that something
ought to be left for ingenious Readers to
find out, I have determined to leave that
whole Affair, although of great Importance,
to their own Discretion.</p>

<p>The Readers must learn by all means
to distinguish between Proverbs and
those polite Speeches which beautify
Conversation: For, as to the former, I
utterly reject them out of all ingenious
Discourse. I acknowledge indeed, that
there may possibly be found in this
Treatise a few Sayings, among so great
a Number of smart Turns of Wit and
Humour, as I have produced, which have
a proverbial Air: However, I hope, it
will be considered, that even these were
not originally Proverbs, but the genuine<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
Productions of superior Wits, to embellish
and support Conversation; from
whence, with great Impropriety, as well
as Plagiarism (if you will forgive a hard
Word) they have most injuriously been
transferred into proverbial Maxims; and
therefore in Justice ought to be resumed
out of vulgar Hands, to adorn the Drawing-Rooms
of Princes, both Male and
Female, the Levees of great Ministers, as
well as the Toilet and Tea-table of the
Ladies.</p>

<p>I can faithfully assure the Reader, that
there is not one single witty Phrase in
this whole Collection, which hath not
received the Stamp and Approbation of
at least one hundred Years, and how
much longer, it is hard to determine; he
may therefore be secure to find them all
genuine, sterling, and authentic.</p>

<p>But before this elaborate Treatise can
become of universal Use and Ornament
to my native Country, Two Points, that
will require Time and much Application,
are absolutely necessary.</p>

<p>For, <i>First</i>, whatever Person would
aspire to be completely witty, smart,
humourous, and polite, must by hard
Labour be able to retain in his Memory<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
every single Sentence contained in this
Work, so as never to be once at a Loss
in applying the right Answers, Questions,
Repartees, and the like, immediately,
and without Study or Hesitation.</p>

<p>And, <i>Secondly</i>, after a Lady or Gentleman
hath so well overcome this Difficulty,
as to be never at a Loss upon any
Emergency, the true Management of
every Feature, and almost of every Limb,
is equally necessary; without which an
infinite Number of Absurdities will inevitably
ensue: For Instance, there is
hardly a polite Sentence in the following
Dialogues which doth not absolutely require
some peculiar graceful Motion in
the Eyes, or Nose, or Mouth, or Forehead,
or Chin, or suitable Toss of the
Head, with certain Offices assigned to
each Hand; and in Ladies, the whole
Exercise of the Fan, fitted to the Energy
of every Word they deliver; by no
means omitting the various Turns and
Cadence of the Voice, the Twistings, and
Movements, and different Postures of the
Body, the several Kinds and Gradations
of Laughter, which the Ladies must daily
practise by the Looking-Glass, and consult
upon them with their Waiting-Maids.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span></p>

<p>My Readers will soon observe what a
great Compass of real and useful Knowledge
this Science includes; wherein, although
Nature, assisted by a Genius, may
be very instrumental, yet a strong Memory
and constant Application, together with
Example and Precept, will be highly
necessary: For these Reasons I have
often wished, that certain Male and
Female Instructors, perfectly versed in
this science, would set up Schools for
the Instruction of young Ladies and
Gentlemen therein.</p>

<p>I remember about thirty Years ago,
there was a <i>Bohemian</i> Woman, of that
Species commonly known by the name
of <i>Gypsies</i>, who came over hither from
<i>France</i>, and generally attended <span class="smcap">Isaac</span>
the Dancing-Master when he was teaching
his Art to Misses of Quality; and
while the young Ladies were thus employed,
the <i>Bohemian</i>, standing at some
distance, but full in their Sight, acted
before them all proper Airs, and turnings
of the Head, and motions of the Hands,
and twistings of the Body; whereof you
may still observe the good Effects in
several of our elder Ladies.</p>

<p>After the same manner, it were much<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
to be desired, that some expert Gentlewomen
gone to decay would set up publick
Schools, wherein young Girls of
Quality, or great Fortunes, might first be
taught to repeat this following System of
Conversation, which I have been at so
much pains to compile; and then to
adapt every Feature of their Countenances,
every Turn of their Hands, every
Screwing of their Bodies, every Exercise
of their Fans, to the Humour of the
Sentences they hear or deliver in Conversation.
But above all to instruct
them in every Species and Degree of
Laughing in the proper seasons at their
own Wit, or that of the Company. And,
if the Sons of the Nobility and Gentry,
instead of being sent to common Schools,
or put into the Hands of Tutors at Home,
to learn nothing but Words, were consigned
to able Instructors in the same
Art, I cannot find what Use there could
be of Books, except in the hands of those
who are to make Learning their Trade,
which is below the Dignity of Persons
born to Titles or Estates.</p>

<p>It would be another infinite Advantage,
that, by cultivating this Science,
we should wholly avoid the Vexations<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
and Impertinence of Pedants, who affect
to talk in a Language not to be understood;
and whenever a polite Person
offers accidentally to use any of their
Jargon-Terms, have the Presumption to
laugh at Us for pronouncing those Words
in a genteeler Manner. Whereas, I do
here affirm, that, whenever any fine
Gentleman or Lady condescends to let
a hard Word pass out of their Mouths,
every syllable is smoothed and polished
in the Passage; and it is a true Mark of
Politeness, both in Writing and Reading,
to vary the Orthography as well as the
Sound; because We are infinitely better
Judges of what will please a distinguishing
ear than those, who call themselves
<i>Scholars</i>, can possibly be; who, consequently,
ought to correct their Books,
and Manner of pronouncing, by the
Authority of Our Example, from whose
lips they proceed with infinitely more
Beauty and Significancy.</p>

<p>But, in the mean time, until so great,
so useful, and so necessary a Design can
be put in execution, (which, considering
the good Disposition of our Country at
present, I shall not despair of living to
see) let me recommend the following<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
Treatise to be carried about as a Pocket-Companion,
by all Gentlemen and Ladies,
when they are going to visit, or dine, or
drink Tea; or where they happen to pass
the Evening without Cards, (as I have
sometimes known it to be the Case upon
Disappointments or Accidents unforeseen)
desiring they would read their
several Parts in their Chairs or Coaches,
to prepare themselves for every kind of
Conversation that can possibly happen.</p>

<p>Although I have in Justice to my
Country, allowed the Genius of our
People to excel that of any other Nation
upon Earth, and have confirmed this
Truth by an Argument not to be controlled,
I mean, by producing so great a
Number of witty Sentences in the ensuing
Dialogues, all of undoubted Authority,
as well as of our own Production;
yet, I must confess at the same
time, that we are wholly indebted for
them to our Ancestors; at least, for as
long as my memory reacheth, I do not
recollect one new Phrase of Importance
to have been added; which Defect in Us
Moderns I take to have been occasioned
by the Introduction of Cant-Words in
the Reign of King <i>Charles</i> the Second.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
And those have so often varied, that
hardly one of them, of above a Year’s
standing, is now intelligible; nor any
where to be found, excepting a small
Number strewed here and there in the
Comedies and other fantastick Writings
of that Age.</p>

<p>The Honourable Colonel <span class="smcap">James Graham</span>,
my old Friend and Companion, did
likewise, towards the End of the same
Reign, invent a Set of Words and
Phrases, which continued almost to the
Time of his Death. But, as those Terms
of Art were adapted only to Courts and
Politicians, and extended little further
than among his particular Acquaintance
(of whom I had the Honour to be one)
they are now almost forgotten.</p>

<p>Nor did the late D. of <i>R——</i> and E.
of <i>E——</i> succeed much better, although
they proceeded no further than single
Words; whereof, except <i>Bite</i>, <i>Bamboozle</i>,
and one or two more, the whole Vocabulary
is antiquated.</p>

<p>The same Fate hath already attended
those other Town-Wits, who furnish us
with a great Variety of new Terms, which
are annually changed, and those of the
last Season sunk in Oblivion. Of these<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
I was once favoured with a compleat
List by the Right Honourable the Lord
and Lady <i>H——</i>, with which I made a
considerable Figure one Summer in the
Country; but returning up to Town in
Winter, and venturing to produce them
again, I was partly hooted, and partly
not understood.</p>

<p>The only Invention of late Years,
which hath any way contributed towards
Politeness in Discourse, is that of abbreviating
or reducing Words of many
Syllables into one, by lopping off the
rest. This Refinement, having begun
about the Time of the <i>Revolution</i>, I had
some Share in the Honour of promoting
it, and I observe, to my great Satisfaction,
that it makes daily Advancements,
and I hope in Time will raise our Language
to the utmost Perfection; although,
I must confess, to avoid Obscurity, I
have been very sparing of this Ornament
in the following Dialogues.</p>

<p>But, as for Phrases, invented to cultivate
Conversation, I defy all the Clubs
of Coffee-houses in this town to invent a
new one equal in Wit, Humour, Smartness,
or Politeness, to the very worst of
my Set; which clearly shews, either that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
we are much degenerated, or that the
whole Stock of Materials hath been
already employed. I would willingly
hope, as I do confidently believe, the
latter; because, having my self, for several
Months, racked my Invention (if
possible) to enrich this Treasury with
some Additions of my own (which, however,
should have been printed in a different
Character, that I might not be
charged with imposing upon the Publick)
and having shewn them to some
judicious Friends, they dealt very sincerely
with me; all unanimously agreeing,
that mine were infinitely below the
true old Helps to Discourse, drawn up in
my present Collection, and confirmed
their Opinion with Reasons, by which I
was perfectly convinced, as well as
ashamed, of my great Presumption.</p>

<p>But, I lately met a much stronger
Argument to confirm me in the same
Sentiments: For, as the great Bishop
<span class="smcap">Burnet</span>, of <i>Salisbury</i>, informs us in the
Preface to his admirable <i>History of his
own Times</i>, that he intended to employ
himself in polishing it every Day of his
Life, (and indeed in its Kind it is almost
equally polished with this Work of mine:)<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
So, it hath been my constant Business,
for some Years past, to examine, with
the utmost Strictness, whether I could
possibly find the smallest Lapse in Style
or Propriety through my whole Collection,
that, in Emulation with the Bishop,
I might send it abroad as the most
finished Piece of the Age.</p>

<p>It happened one Day as I was dining
in good Company of both Sexes, and
watching, according to my Custom, for
new Materials wherewith to fill my
Pocket-Book, I succeeded well enough
till after Dinner, when the Ladies retired
to their Tea, and left us over a Bottle of
Wine. But I found we were not able to
furnish any more Materials, that were
worth the Pains of transcribing: For, the
Discourse of the Company was all degenerated
into smart Sayings of their
own Invention, and not of the true old
Standard; so that, in absolute Despair,
I withdrew, and went to attend the
Ladies at their Tea. From whence I
did then conclude, and still continue to
believe, either that Wine doth not inspire
Politeness, or that our Sex is not
able to support it without the Company
of Women, who never fail to lead<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
us into the right Way, and there to
keep us.</p>

<p>It much encreaseth the Value of these
Apophthegms, that unto them we owe
the Continuance of our Language, for at
least an hundred Years; neither is this
to be wondered at; because indeed, besides
the Smartness of the Wit, and Fineness
of the Raillery, such is the Propriety
and Energy of Expression in them all,
that they never can be changed, but to
Disadvantage, except in the Circumstance
of using Abbreviations; which,
however, I do not despair, in due Time,
to see introduced, having already met
them at some of the Choice Companies
in town.</p>

<p>Although this Work be calculated for
all Persons of Quality and Fortune of
both Sexes; yet the Reader may perceive,
that my particular View was to
the <span class="smcap">Officers</span> of the <span class="smcap">Army</span>, the <span class="smcap">Gentlemen</span>
of the <span class="smcap">Inns</span> of <span class="smcap">Courts</span>, and of
<span class="smcap">Both</span> the <span class="smcap">Universities</span>; to all <span class="smcap">Courtiers</span>,
Male and Female, but principally
to the <span class="smcap">Maids</span> of <span class="smcap">Honour</span>, of whom I
have been personally acquainted with
two-and-twenty Sets, all excelling in this
noble Endowment; till for some Years<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
past, I know not how, they came to degenerate
into Selling of <span class="smcap">Bargains</span>, and
<span class="smcap">Free-Thinking</span>; not that I am against
either of these Entertainments at proper
Seasons, in compliance with Company,
who may want a Taste for more exalted
Discourse, whose Memories may be short,
who are too young to be perfect in their
Lessons. Or (although it be hard to
conceive) who have no Inclination to
read and learn my Instructions. And
besides, there is a strong Temptation for
Court-Ladies to fall into the two Amusements
above-mentioned, that they may
avoid the Censure of affecting Singularity,
against the general Current and
Fashion of all about them: But, however,
no Man will pretend to affirm, that
either <span class="smcap">Bargains</span> or <span class="smcap">Blasphemy</span>, which
are the principal Ornaments of <span class="smcap">Free-Thinking</span>,
are so good a Fund of polite
Discourse, as what is to be met with in
my Collection. For, as to <span class="smcap">Bargains</span>,
few of them seem to be excellent in
their kind, and have not much Variety,
because they all terminate in one single
Point; and, to multiply them, would require
more Invention than People have
to spare. And, as to <span class="smcap">Blasphemy</span> or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
<span class="smcap">Free-Thinking</span>, I have known some
scrupulous Persons, of both Sexes, who,
by a prejudiced Education, are afraid of
Sprights. I must, however, except the
<span class="smcap">Maids</span> of <span class="smcap">Honour</span>, who have been fully
convinced, by an infamous Court-Chaplain,
that there is no such Place as Hell.</p>

<p>I cannot, indeed, controvert the Lawfulness
of <span class="smcap">Free-Thinking</span>, because
it hath been universally allowed, that
Thought is free. But, however, although
it may afford a large Field of Matter;
yet in my poor Opinion, it seems to contain
very little of Wit or Humour; because
it hath not been antient enough
among us to furnish established authentick
Expressions, I mean, such as must
receive a Sanction from the polite World,
before their Authority can be allowed;
neither was the Art of <span class="smcap">Blasphemy</span> or
<span class="smcap">Free-Thinking</span> invented by the Court,
or by Persons of great Quality, who,
properly speaking, were Patrons, rather
than Inventors of it; but first brought
in by the Fanatick Faction, towards the
end of their Power, and, after the Restoration,
carried to <i>Whitehall</i> by the converted
<i>Rumpers</i>, with very good Reasons;
because they knew, that K. <i>Charles</i> the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
Second, who, from a wrong Education,
occasioned by the Troubles of his Father,
had Time enough to observe, that
Fanatick Enthusiasm directly led to
Atheism, which agreed with the dissolute
Inclinations of his Youth; and, perhaps,
these Principles were farther cultivated
in him by the <i>French</i> Huguenots,
who have been often charged with
spreading them among us: However, I
cannot see where the Necessity lies, of
introducing new and foreign Topicks for
Conversation, while we have so plentiful
a Stock of our own Growth.</p>

<p>I have likewise, for some Reasons of
equal Weight, been very sparing in
<span class="smcap">Double Entendres</span>; because they
often put Ladies upon affected Constraints,
and affected Ignorance. In
short, they break, or very much entangle,
the Thread of Discourse; neither am I
Master of any Rules, to settle the disconcerted
Countenances of the Females
in such a Juncture; I can, therefore, only
allow <i>Inuendoes</i> of this Kind to be delivered
in Whispers, and only to young
Ladies under Twenty, who, being in
Honour obliged to blush, it may produce
a new Subject for Discourse.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span></p>

<p>Perhaps the Criticks may accuse me
of a Defect in my following System of
<span class="smcap">Polite Conversation</span>; that there is
one great Ornament of Discourse, whereof
I have not produced a single Example;
which, indeed, I purposely omitted for
some Reasons that I shall immediately
offer; and, if those Reasons will not
satisfy the Male Part of my gentle
Readers, the Defect may be supplied in
some manner by an <i>Appendix</i> to the
<i>Second Edition</i>; which <i>Appendix</i> shall
be printed by it self, and sold for <i>Sixpence</i>,
stitched, and with a Marble Cover,
that my Readers may have no Occasion
to complain of being defrauded.</p>

<p>The Defect I mean is, my not having
inserted, into the Body of my Book, all
the <span class="smcap">Oaths</span> now most in Fashion for
embellishing Discourse; especially since
it could give no Offence to the <i>Clergy</i>,
who are seldom or never admitted to
these polite Assemblies. And it must
be allowed, that Oaths, well chosen, are
not only very useful Expletives to Matter,
but great Ornaments of Style.</p>

<p>What I shall here offer in my own
Defence upon this important Article, will,
I hope, be some Extenuation of my Fault.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span></p>

<p>First, I reasoned with my self, that a
just Collection of Oaths, repeated as
often as the Fashion requires, must have
enlarged this Volume, at least, to Double
the Bulk; whereby it would not only
double the Charge, but likewise make
the Volume less commodious for Pocket-Carriage.</p>

<p>Secondly, I have been assured by some
judicious Friends, that themselves have
known certain Ladies to take Offence
(whether seriously or no) at too great a
Profusion of Cursing and Swearing, even
when that Kind of Ornament was not
improperly introduced; which, I confess,
did startle me not a little; having never
observed the like in the Compass of my
own several Acquaintance, at least for
twenty Years past. However, I was
forced to submit to wiser Judgments
than my own.</p>

<p>Thirdly, as this most useful Treatise
is calculated for all future Times, I considered,
in this Maturity of my Age, how
great a Variety of Oaths I have heard
since I began to study the World, and
to know Men and Manners. And here I
found it to be true what I have read in
an antient Poet.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span></p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">“For, now-a-days, Men change their Oaths,</div>
<div class="verse">As often as they change their Cloaths.”</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>In short, Oaths are the Children of
Fashion, they are in some sense almost
Annuals, like what I observed before of
Cant-Words; and I my self can remember
about forty different Sets. The old
Stock-Oaths I am confident, do not
mount to above forty five, or fifty at
most; but the Way of mingling and
compounding them is almost as various
as that of the Alphabet.</p>

<p>Sir <span class="smcap">John Perrot</span> was the first Man
of Quality whom I find upon Record to
have sworn by <i>G—’s W—s</i>. He lived
in the Reign of Q. <i>Elizabeth</i>, and was
supposed to have been a natural Son of
<i>Henry</i> the Eighth, who might also have
probably been his Instructor. This Oath
indeed still continues, and is a Stock-Oath
to this Day; so do several others
that have kept their natural Simplicity:
But, infinitely the greater Number hath
been so frequently changed and dislocated,
that if the Inventors were now
alive, they could hardly understand them.</p>

<p>Upon these Considerations I began to
apprehend, that if I should insert all the
Oaths as are now current, my Book<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
would be out of Vogue with the first
Change of Fashion, and grow useless as
an old Dictionary: Whereas, the Case is
quite otherways with my Collection of
polite Discourse; which, as I before observed,
hath descended by Tradition for
at least an hundred Years, without any
Change in the Phraseology. I, therefore,
determined with my self to leave out the
whole System of Swearing; because,
both the male and female Oaths are all
perfectly well known and distinguished;
new ones are easily learnt, and with a
moderate Share of Discretion may be
properly applied on every fit Occasion.
However, I must here, upon this Article
of Swearing, most earnestly recommend
to my male Readers, that they would
please a little to study Variety. For, it
is the Opinion of our most refined
Swearers, that the same Oath or Curse,
cannot, consistent with true Politeness,
be repeated above nine Times in the
same Company, by the same Person, and
at one Sitting.</p>

<p>I am far from desiring, or expecting,
that all the polite and ingenious Speeches,
contained in this Work, should, in the
general Conversation between Ladies<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
and Gentlemen, come in so quick and so
close as I have here delivered them. By
no means: On the contrary, they ought
to be husbanded better, and spread
much thinner. Nor, do I make the least
Question, but that, by a discreet thrifty
Management, they may serve for the
Entertainment of a whole Year, to any
Person, who does not make too long or
too frequent Visits in the same Family.
The Flowers of Wit, Fancy, Wisdom,
Humour, and Politeness, scattered in this
Volume, amount to one thousand, seventy
and four. Allowing then to every Gentleman
and Lady thirty visiting Families,
(not insisting upon Fractions) there will
want but little of an hundred polite
Questions, Answers, Replies, Rejoinders,
Repartees, and Remarks, to be daily delivered
fresh, in every Company, for
twelve solar Months; and even this is a
higher Pitch of Delicacy than the World
insists on, or hath Reason to expect.
But, I am altogether for exalting this
Science to its utmost Perfection.</p>

<p>It may be objected, that the Publication
of my Book may, in a long Course
of Time, prostitute this noble Art to
mean and vulgar People: But, I answer;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
That it is not so easy an Acquirement
as a few ignorant Pretenders may imagine.
A Footman can swear; but he
cannot swear like a Lord. He can swear
as often: But, can he swear with equal
Delicacy, Propriety, and Judgment? No,
certainly; unless he be a Lad of superior
Parts, of good Memory, a diligent Observer;
one who hath a skilful Ear, some
Knowledge in Musick, and an exact
Taste, which hardly fall to the Share of
one in a thousand among that Fraternity,
in as high Favour as they now stand
with their Ladies; neither hath one
Footman in six so fine a Genius as to
relish and apply those exalted Sentences
comprised in this Volume, which I offer
to the World: It is true, I cannot see
that the same ill Consequences would
follow from the Waiting-Woman, who,
if she hath been bred to read Romances,
may have some small subaltern, or
second-hand Politeness; and if she constantly
attends the Tea, and be a good
Listner, may, in some Years, make a
tolerable Figure, which will serve, perhaps,
to draw in the young Chaplain or
the old Steward. But, alas! after all,
how can she acquire those hundreds of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
Graces and Motions, and Airs, the whole
military Management of the Fan, the
Contortions of every muscular Motion
in the Face, the Risings and Fallings,
the Quickness and Slowness of the
Voice, with the several Turns and Cadences;
the proper Junctures of Smiling
and Frowning, how often and how loud
to laugh, when to jibe and when to flout,
with all the other Branches of Doctrine
and Discipline above-recited?</p>

<p>I am, therefore, not under the least
Apprehension that this Art will be ever
in Danger of falling into common Hands,
which requires so much Time, Study,
Practice, and Genius, before it arrives to
Perfection; and, therefore, I must repeat
my Proposal for erecting Publick Schools,
provided with the best and ablest Masters
and Mistresses, at the Charge of the
Nation.</p>

<p>I have drawn this Work into the
Form of a Dialogue, after the Patterns
of other famous Writers in History,
Law, Politicks, and most other Arts and
Sciences, and I hope it will have the
same Success: For, who can contest it
to be of greater Consequence to the
Happiness of these Kingdoms, than all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
human Knowledge put together. Dialogue
is held the best Method of inculcating
any Part of Knowledge; and, as
I am confident, that Publick Schools will
soon be founded for teaching Wit and
Politeness, after my Scheme, to young
People of Quality and Fortune, I have
determined next Sessions to deliver a
Petition to the <i>House of Lords</i> for an
Act of Parliament, to establish my Book,
as the Standard <i>Grammar</i> in all the
principal Cities of the Kingdom where
this Art is to be taught, by able Masters,
who are to be approved and recommended
by me; which is no more than
<span class="smcap">Lilly</span> obtained only for teaching Words
in a Language wholly useless: Neither
shall I be so far wanting to my self, as
not to desire a Patent granted of course
to all useful Projectors; I mean, that I
may have the sole Profit of giving a
Licence to every School to read my
<i>Grammar</i> for fourteen Years.</p>

<p>The Reader cannot but observe what
Pains I have been at in polishing the
Style of my Book to the greatest Exactness:
Nor, have I been less diligent in
refining the Orthography, by spelling
the Words in the very same Manner<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
that they are pronounced by the Chief
Patterns of Politeness, at Court, at Levees,
at Assemblees, at Play-houses, at the
prime Visiting-Places, by young Templers,
and by Gentlemen-Commoners of
both Universities, who have lived at least
a Twelvemonth in Town, and kept the
best Company. Of these Spellings the
Publick will meet with many Examples
in the following Book. For instance,
<i>can’t</i>, <i>han’t</i>, <i>sha’nt</i>, <i>didn’t</i>, <i>coodn’t</i>, <i>woodn’t</i>,
<i>isn’t</i>, <i>e’n’t</i>, with many more; besides
several Words which Scholars pretend
are derived from <i>Greek</i> and <i>Latin</i>, but
not pared into a polite Sound by Ladies,
Officers of the Army, Courtiers and
Templers, such as <i>Jommetry</i> for <i>Geometry</i>,
<i>Verdi</i> for <i>Verdict</i>, <i>Lierd</i> for <i>Lord</i>, <i>Larnen</i>
for <i>Learning</i>; together with some Abbreviations
exquisitely refined; as, <i>Pozz</i> for
<i>Positive</i>; <i>Mobb</i> for <i>Mobile</i>; <i>Phizz</i> for
<i>Physiognomy</i>; <i>Rep</i> for <i>Reputation</i>; <i>Plenipo</i>
for <i>Plenipotentiary</i>; <i>Incog</i> for <i>Incognito</i>;
<i>Hypps</i>, or <i>Hippo</i>, for <i>Hypocondriacks</i>;
<i>Bam</i> for <i>Bamboozle</i>; and <i>Bamboozle</i>
for <i>God knows what</i>; whereby
much Time is saved, and the high Road
to Conversation cut short by many a
Mile.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span></p>

<p>I have, as it will be apparent, laboured
very much, and, I hope, with Felicity
enough, to make every Character in the
Dialogue agreeable with it self, to a degree,
that, whenever any judicious Person
shall read my Book aloud, for the Entertainment
and Instruction of a select Company,
he need not so much as name the
particular Speakers; because all the Persons,
throughout the several Subjects of
Conversation, strictly observe a different
Manner, peculiar to their Characters,
which are of different kinds: But this I
leave entirely to the prudent and impartial
Reader’s Discernment.</p>

<p>Perhaps the very Manner of introducing
the several Points of Wit and Humour
may not be less entertaining and instructing
than the Matter it self. In the latter
I can pretend to little Merit; because it
entirely depends upon Memory and the
Happiness of having kept polite Company.
But, the Art of contriving, that
those Speeches should be introduced
naturally, as the most proper Sentiments
to be delivered upon so great Variety
of Subjects, I take to be a Talent somewhat
uncommon, and a Labour that few
People could hope to succeed in unless<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
they had a Genius, particularly turned
that way, added to a sincere disinterested
Love of the Publick.</p>

<p>Although every curious Question, smart
Answer, and witty Reply be little known
to many People; yet, there is not one
single Sentence in the whole Collection,
for which I cannot bring most authentick
Vouchers, whenever I shall be called;
and, even for some Expressions, which to
a few nice Ears may perhaps appear
somewhat gross, I can produce the Stamp
of Authority from Courts, Chocolate-houses,
Theatres, Assemblees, Drawing-rooms,
Levees, Card-meetings, Balls, and
Masquerades, from Persons of both
Sexes, and of the highest Titles next to
Royal. However, to say the truth, I
have been very sparing in my Quotations
of such Sentiments that seem to be
over free; because, when I began my
Collection, such kind of Converse was
almost in its Infancy, till it was taken
into the Protection of my honoured
Patronesses at Court, by whose Countenance
and Sanction it hath become a
choice Flower in the Nosegay of Wit and
Politeness.</p>

<p>Some will perhaps object, that when<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
I bring my Company to Dinner, I mention
too great a Variety of Dishes, not
always consistent with the Art of
Cookery, or proper for the Season of the
Year, and Part of the first Course mingled
with the second, besides a Failure in
Politeness, by introducing Black Pudden
to a Lord’s Table, and at a great Entertainment:
But, if I had omitted the
Black Pudden, I desire to know what
would have become of that exquisite
Reason given by Miss <span class="smcap">Notable</span> for not
eating it; the World perhaps might have
lost it for ever, and I should have been
justly answerable for having left it out of
my Collection. I therefore cannot but
hope, that such Hypercritical Readers
will please to consider, my Business was
to make so full and compleat a Body of
refined Sayings, as compact as I could;
only taking care to produce them in the
most natural and probable Manner, in
order to allure my Readers into the very
Substance and Marrow of this most admirable
and necessary Art.</p>

<p>I am heartily sorry, and was much disappointed
to find, that so universal and
polite an Entertainment as <span class="smcap">Cards</span>, hath
hitherto contributed very little to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
Enlargement of my Work; I have sate
by many hundred Times with the
utmost Vigilance, and my Table-Book
ready, without being able in eight Hours
to gather Matter for one single Phrase in
my Book. But this, I think, may be
easily accounted for by the Turbulence
and Justling of Passions upon the various
and surprising Turns, Incidents, Revolutions,
and Events of good and evil Fortune,
that arrive in the course of a long
Evening at Play; the Mind being wholly
taken up, and the Consequence of Non-attention
so fatal.</p>

<p>Play is supported upon the two great
Pillars of Deliberation and Action. The
Terms of Art are few, prescribed by Law
and Custom; no Time allowed for Digressions
or Tryals of Wit. <span class="smcap">Quadrille</span>
in particular bears some Resemblance to
a State of Nature, which, we are told, is
a State of War, wherein every Woman
is against every Woman: The Unions
short, inconstant, and soon broke; the
League made this Minute without knowing
the Ally; and dissolved in the next.
Thus, at the Game of <span class="smcap">Quadrille</span>, female
Brains are always employed in
Stratagem, or their Hands in Action.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
Neither can I find, that our Art hath
gained much by the happy Revival of
<span class="smcap">Masquerading</span> among us; the whole
Dialogue in those Meetings being summed
up in one sprightly (I confess, but) single
Question, and as sprightly an Answer.
<span class="smcap">Do you know me? Yes, I do.</span> And,
<span class="smcap">Do you know me? Yes, I do</span>. For
this Reason I did not think it proper to
give my Readers the Trouble of introducing
a Masquerade, meerly for the
sake of a single Question, and a single
Answer. Especially, when to perform
this in a proper manner, I must have
brought in a hundred Persons together,
of both Sexes, dressed in fantastick
Habits for one Minute, and dismiss them
the next.</p>

<p>Neither is it reasonable to conceive,
that our Science can be much improved
by Masquerades; where the Wit of both
Sexes is altogether taken up in continuing
singular and humoursome Disguises;
and their Thoughts entirely employed in
bringing Intrigues and Assignations of
Gallantry to an happy Conclusion.</p>

<p>The judicious Reader will readily discover,
that I make Miss <span class="smcap">Notable</span> my
Heroin, and Mr. <span class="smcap">Thomas Never-out<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span></span>
my Hero. I have laboured both their
Characters with my utmost Ability. It
is into their Mouths that I have put the
liveliest Questions, Answers, Repartees,
and Rejoynders; because my Design
was to propose them both as Patterns
for all young Batchelors and single
Ladies to copy after. By which I hope
very soon to see polite Conversation
flourish between both Sexes in a more
consummate Degree of Perfection, than
these Kingdoms have yet ever known.</p>

<p>I have drawn some Lines of Sir <span class="smcap">John
Linger’s</span> Character, the <i>Derbyshire</i>
Knight, on purpose to place it in Counter-view
or Contrast with that of the other
Company; wherein I can assure the
Reader, that I intended not the least
Reflexion upon <i>Derbyshire</i>, the Place of
my Nativity. But, my Intention was
only to shew the Misfortune of those
Persons, who have the Disadvantage to
be bred out of the Circle of Politeness;
whereof I take the present Limits to extend
no further than <i>London</i>, and ten
Miles round; although others are please
to compute it within the Bills of Mortality.
If you compare the Discourses of my
Gentlemen and Ladies with those of Sir<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
<span class="smcap">John</span>, you will hardly conceive him to
have been bred in the same Climate, or
under the same Laws, Language, Religion,
or Government: And, accordingly,
I have introduced him speaking in his own
rude Dialect, for no other Reason than
to teach my Scholars how to avoid it.</p>

<p>The curious Reader will observe, that
when Conversation appears in danger to
flag, which, in some Places, I have artfully
contrived, I took care to invent
some sudden Question, or Turn of Wit,
to revive it; such as these that follow.
<i>What? I think here’s a silent Meeting!</i>
<i>Come, Madam, A Penny for your
Thought</i>; with several other of the like
sort. I have rejected all provincial or
country Turns of Wit and Fancy, because
I am acquainted with a very few; but,
indeed, chiefly because I found them so
very much inferior to those at Court,
especially among the Gentlemen-Ushers,
the Ladies of the Bed-Chamber, and the
Maids of Honour; I must also add, the
hither End of our noble Metropolis.</p>

<p>When this happy Art of polite Conversing
shall be thoroughly improved,
good Company will be no longer pestered
with dull, dry, tedious Story-tellers, nor<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
brangling Disputers: For, a right
Scholar, of either Sex, in our Science,
will perpetually interrupt them with
some sudden surprising Piece of Wit, that
shall engage all the Company in a loud
Laugh; and, if after a Pause, the grave
Companion resumes his Thread in the
following Manner; <i>Well, but to go on
with my Story</i>; new Interruptions come
from the Left to the Right, till he is
forced to give over.</p>

<p>I have made some few Essays toward
<i>Selling of</i> <span class="smcap">Bargains</span>, as well for instructing
those, who delight in that Accomplishment,
as in compliance with my
Female Friends at Court. However, I
have transgressed a little in this Point, by
doing it in a manner somewhat more reserved
than as it is now practiced at St.
<i>James</i>’s. At the same time, I can hardly
allow this Accomplishment to pass properly
for a Branch of that perfect polite
Conversation, which makes the constituent
Subject of my Treatise; and, for which
I have already given my Reasons. I have
likewise, for further Caution, left a Blank
in the critical Point of each <i>Bargain</i>,
which the sagacious Reader may fill up in
his own Mind.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span></p>

<p>As to my self, I am proud to own, that
except some Smattering in the <i>French</i>, I
am what the Pedants and Scholars call, a
Man wholly illiterate, that is to say, unlearned.
But, as to my own Language,
I shall not readily yield to many Persons:
I have read most of the Plays, and all the
miscellany Poems that have been published
for twenty Years past. I have
read Mr. <i>Thomas Brown</i>’s Works entire,
and had the Honour to be his intimate
Friend, who was universally allowed to be
the greatest Genius of his Age.</p>

<p>Upon what Foot I stand with the present
chief reigning Wits, their Verses
recommendatory, which they have commended
me to prefix before my Book,
will be more than a thousand Witnesses:
I am, and have been, likewise, particularly
acquainted with Mr. <span class="smcap">Charles Gildon</span>,
Mr. <span class="smcap">Ward</span>, Mr. <span class="smcap">Dennis</span>, that admirable
Critick and Poet, and several others.
Each of these eminent Persons (I mean,
those who are still alive) have done me
the Honour to read this Production five
Times over with the strictest Eye of
friendly Severity, and proposed some,
although very few, Amendments, which
I gratefully accepted, and do here publickly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
return my Acknowledgment for
so singular a Favour.</p>

<p>And here, I cannot conceal, without
Ingratitude, the great Assistance I have
received from those two illustrious Writers,
Mr. <span class="smcap">Ozel</span>, and Captain <span class="smcap">Stevens</span>. These,
and some others, of distinguished Eminence,
in whose Company I have passed
so many agreeable Hours, as they have
been the great Refiners of our Language;
so, it hath been my chief Ambition to
imitate them. Let the <span class="smcap">Popes</span>, the <span class="smcap">Gays</span>,
the <span class="smcap">Arbuthnots</span>, the <span class="smcap">Youngs</span>, and the
rest of that snarling Brood burst with
Envy at the Praises we receive from the
Court and Kingdom.</p>

<p>But to return from this Digression.</p>

<p>The Reader will find that the following
Collection of polite Expressions will
easily incorporate with all Subjects of
genteel and fashionable Life. Those,
which are proper for Morning-Tea, will
be equally useful at the same Entertainment
in the Afternoon, even in the same
Company, only by shifting the several
Questions, Answers, and Replies, into
different Hands; and such as are adapted
to Meals will indifferently serve for Dinners
or Suppers, only distinguishing between<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
Day-light and Candle-light. By this
Method no diligent Person, of a tolerable
Memory, can ever be at a loss.</p>

<p>It hath been my constant Opinion, that
every Man, who is intrusted by Nature
with any useful Talent of the Mind, is
bound by all the Ties of Honour, and
that Justice which we all owe our Country,
to propose to himself some one illustrious
Action, to be performed in his Life
for the publick Emolument. And, I freely
confess, that so grand, so important an
Enterprize as I have undertaken, and
executed to the best of my Power, well
deserved a much abler Hand, as well as
a liberal Encouragement from the Crown.
However, I am bound so far to acquit
my self, as to declare, that I have often
and most earnestly intreated several of
my above-named Friends, universally
allowed to be of the first Rank in Wit
and Politeness, that they would undertake
a Work, so honourable to themselves,
and so beneficial to the Kingdom;
but so great was their Modesty, that they
all thought fit to excuse themselves, and
impose the Task on me; yet in so obliging
a Manner, and attended with such Compliments
on my poor Qualifications, that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
I dare not repeat. And, at last, their Intreaties,
or rather their Commands, added
to that inviolable Love I bear to the Land
of my Nativity, prevailed upon me to engage
in so bold an Attempt.</p>

<p>I may venture to affirm, without the
least Violation of Modesty, that there is
no Man, now alive, who hath, by many
Degrees, so just Pretensions as my self,
to the highest Encouragement from the
<span class="smcap">Crown</span>, the <span class="smcap">Parliament</span>, and the <span class="smcap">Ministry</span>,
towards bringing this Work to its
due Perfection. I have been assured, that
several great Heroes of antiquity were
worshipped as Gods, upon the Merit of
having civilized a fierce and barbarous
People. It is manifest, I could have no
other Intentions; and, I dare appeal to
my very Enemies, if such a Treatise as
mine had been published some Years
ago, and with as much Success as I am
confident this will meet, I mean, by turning
the Thoughts of the whole Nobility
and Gentry to the Study and Practice of
polite Conversation; whether such mean
stupid Writers, as the <span class="smcap">Craftsman</span> and
his Abettors, could have been able to
corrupt the Principles of so many hundred
thousand Subjects, as, to the Shame<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
and Grief of every whiggish, loyal, and
true Protestant Heart, it is too manifest,
they have done. For, I desire the honest
judicious Reader to make one Remark,
that after having exhausted the Whole<a name="FNanchor_2" id="FNanchor_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a>
<i>In sickly payday</i> (if I may so call it) of
Politeness and Refinement, and faithfully
digested it in the following Dialogues,
there cannot be found one Expression
relating to Politicks; that the <span class="smcap">Ministry</span>
is never mentioned, nor the Word <span class="smcap">King</span>,
above twice or thrice, and then only to
the Honour of Majesty; so very cautious
were our wiser Ancestors in forming Rules
for Conversation, as never to give Offence
to Crowned Heads, nor interfere with
Party Disputes in the State. And indeed,
although there seem to be a close
Resemblance between the two Words
<i>Politeness</i> and <i>Politicks</i>, yet no Ideas are
more inconsistent in their Natures. However,
to avoid all Appearance of Disaffection,
I have taken care to enforce Loyalty
by an invincible Argument, drawn from
the very Fountain of this noble Science,
in the following short Terms, that ought<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
to be writ in Gold, <span class="smcap">Must is for the
King</span>; which uncontroulable Maxim I
took particular Care of introducing in
the first Page of my Book; thereby to
instil early the best Protestant Loyal
Notions into the Minds of my Readers.
Neither is it meerly my own private
Opinion, that Politeness is the firmest
Foundation upon which Loyalty can be
supported: For, thus happily sings the
Divine Mr. <i>Tibbalds</i>, or <i>Theobalds</i>, in one
of his Birth-Day Poems.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">“I am no Schollard; but I am polite:</div>
<div class="verse">Therefore be sure I am no <i>Jacobite</i>.”</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Hear likewise, to the same purpose,
that great Master of the whole Poetick
Choir, our most illustrious Laureat Mr.
<span class="smcap">Colly Cibber</span>.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">“Who in his Talk can’t speak a polite Thing,</div>
<div class="verse">Will never loyal be to <span class="smcap">George</span> <i>our King</i>.”</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>I could produce many more shining
Passages out of our principal Poets, of
both Sexes, to confirm this momentous
Truth. From whence, I think, it may
be fairly concluded, that whoever can
most contribute towards propagating the
Science contained in the following Sheets,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
through the Kingdoms of <i>Great-Britain</i>
and <i>Ireland</i>, may justly demand all the
Favour, that the wisest Court, and most
judicious Senate, are able to confer on
the most deserving Subject. I leave the
Application to my Readers.</p>

<p>This is the Work, which I have been
so hardy to attempt, and without the
least mercenary View. Neither do I
doubt of succeeding to my full Wish,
except among the <span class="smcap">Tories</span> and their
Abettors; who being all <i>Jacobites</i>, and,
consequently <i>Papists</i> in their Hearts,
from a Want of true Taste, or by strong
Affectation, may perhaps resolve not to
read my Book; chusing rather to deny
themselves the Pleasure and Honour of
shining in polite Company among the
principal Genius’s of both Sexes throughout
the Kingdom, than adorn their Minds
with this noble Art; and probably apprehending
(as, I confess nothing is more
likely to happen) that a true Spirit of
Loyalty to the Protestant Succession
should steal in along with it.</p>

<p>If my favourable and gentle Readers
could possibly conceive the perpetual
Watchings, the numberless Toils, the
frequent Risings in the Night, to set<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
down several ingenious Sentences, that I
suddenly or accidentally recollected; and
which, without my utmost Vigilance, had
been irrecoverably lost for ever: If they
would consider with what incredible Diligence
I daily and nightly attended at
those Houses, where Persons of both
Sexes, and of the most distinguished
Merit, used to meet and display their
Talents; with what Attention I listened
to all their Discourses, the better to retain
them in my Memory; and then, at
proper Seasons, withdrew unobserved, to
enter them in my Table-Book, while the
Company little suspected what a noble
Work I had then in Embryo: I say, if
all these were known to the World, I
think, it would be no great Presumption
in me to expect, at a proper Juncture,
the publick Thanks of both Houses of
Parliament, for the Service and Honour
I have done to the whole Nation by my
single Pen.</p>

<p>Although I have never been once
charged with the least Tincture of
Vanity, the Reader will, I hope, give me
leave to put an easy Question: What is
become of all the King of <i>Sweden</i>’s Victories?
Where are the Fruits of them at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
this Day? or, of what Benefit will they
be to Posterity? were not many of his
greatest Actions owing, at least in part,
to Fortune? were not all of them owing
to the Valour of his Troops, as much
as to his own Conduct? could he have
conquered the <i>Polish</i> King, or the
<i>Czar</i> of <i>Muscovy</i>, with his single Arm?
Far be it from me to envy or lessen the
Fame he hath acquired; but, at the same
time, I will venture to say, without Breach
of Modesty, that I, who have alone with
this Right-hand subdued Barbarism,
Rudeness, and Rusticity, who have established
and fixed for ever the whole System
of all true Politeness and Refinement
in Conversation, should think my
self most inhumanely treated by my
Country-men, and would accordingly resent
it as the highest Indignity, to be
put upon the level, in point of Fame, in
After-ages, with <span class="smcap">Charles</span> the Twelfth,
late King of <i>Sweden</i>.</p>

<p>And yet, so incurable is the Love of
Detraction, perhaps beyond what the
charitable Reader will easily believe, that
I have been assured by more than one
credible Person, how some of my
Enemies have industriously whispered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
about, that one <span class="smcap">Isaac Newton</span>, an Instrument-maker,
formerly living near
<i>Leicester-Fields</i>, and afterwards a Workman
at the Mint in the <i>Tower</i>, might
possibly pretend to vye with me for
Fame in future times. The Man it seems
was knighted for making Sun-Dials better
than others of his Trade, and was thought
to be a Conjurer, because he knew how
to draw Lines and Circles upon a Slate,
which no body could understand. But,
adieu to all noble Attempts for endless
Renown, if the Ghost of an obscure Mechanick
shall be raised up to enter into
competition with me, only for his Skill
in making Pot-hooks and Hangers with
a Pencil, which many thousand accomplished
Gentlemen and Ladies can perform
as well with a Pen and Ink upon a
Piece of Paper, and, in a manner, as
little intelligible as those of Sir <span class="smcap">Isaac</span>.</p>

<p>My most ingenious Friend already
mentioned, Mr. <span class="smcap">Colly Cibber</span>, who
does too much Honour to the Laurel
Crown he deservedly wears (as he hath
often done to many Imperial Diadems
placed on his Head) was pleased to tell
me, that, if my Treatise were formed
into a Comedy, the Representation, performed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
to Advantage on our Theatre
might very much contribute to the
Spreading of polite Conversation among
all Persons of Distinction through the
whole Kingdom.</p>

<p>I own, the Thought was ingenious,
and my Friend’s Intention good. But,
I cannot agree to his Proposal: For, Mr.
<span class="smcap">Cibber</span> himself allowed, that the Subjects
handled in my Work, being so
numerous and extensive, it would be absolutely
impossible for one, two, or even
six Comedies to contain them. From
whence it will follow, that many admirable
and essential Rules for polite Conversation
must be omitted.</p>

<p>And here let me do justice to my
Friend Mr. <span class="smcap">Tibalds</span>, who plainly confessed
before Mr. <span class="smcap">Cibber</span> himself, that
such a Project, as it would be a great
Diminution to my Honour, so it would
intolerably mangle my Scheme, and
thereby destroy the principal End at
which I aimed, to form a compleat Body
or System of this most useful Science in
all its Parts. And therefore Mr. <span class="smcap">Tibbalds</span>,
whose Judgment was never disputed,
chose rather to fall in with my
Proposal mentioned before, of erecting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
publick Schools and Seminaries all over
the Kingdom, to instruct the young
People of both Sexes in this Art, according
to my Rules, and in the Method that
I have laid down.</p>

<p>I shall conclude this long, but necessary
Introduction, with a Request, or
indeed rather, a just and reasonable Demand
from all Lords, Ladies, and Gentlemen,
that while they are entertaining
and improving each other with those
polite Questions, Answers, Repartees,
Replies, and Rejoinders, which I have
with infinite Labour, and close Application,
during the Space of thirty-six
Years, been collecting for their Service
and Improvement, they shall, as an Instance
of Gratitude, on every proper
Occasion, quote my Name, after this or
the like manner. <i>Madam, as our Master</i>
<span class="smcap">Wagstaff</span> <i>says</i>. <i>My Lord, as our Friend</i>
<span class="smcap">Wagstaff</span> <i>has it</i>. I do likewise expect,
that all my Pupils shall drink my Health
every Day at Dinner and Supper during
my Life; and that they, or their Posterity,
shall continue the same Ceremony to my
<i>not inglorious Memory</i>, after my Decease,
for ever.</p>

<p><i>Col.</i> Well met, my Lord.</p>

<p><i>Ld. Sparkish.</i> Thank ye, Colonel. A
Parson would have said, I hope we shall
meet in Heaven. When did you see
<i>Tom Neverout</i>?</p>

<p><i>Col.</i> He’s just coming towards us.
Talk of the Devil——</p>

<p class="direction">[Neverout <i>comes up</i>.</p>

<p><i>Col.</i> How do you do, <i>Tom</i>?</p>

<p><i>Neverout.</i> Never the better for you.</p>

<p><i>Col.</i> I hope, you’re never the worse.
But where’s your Manners? Don’t you
see my Lord <i>Sparkish</i>?</p>

<p><i>Neverout.</i> My Lord, I beg your Lordship’s
Pardon.</p>

<p><i>Ld. Sparkish.</i> <i>Tom</i>, how is it, that you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
can’t see the Wood for Trees? What
Wind blew you hither?</p>

<p><i>Neverout.</i> Why, my Lord, it is an ill
Wind blows nobody good; for it gives
me the Honour of seeing your Lordship.</p>

<p><i>Col.</i> <i>Tom</i>, you must go with us to
Lady <i>Smart</i>’s to Breakfast.</p>

<p><i>Neverout.</i> Must? Why, Colonel, Must’s
for the King.</p>

<p class="direction">[<i>Col. offering in Jest to draw his Sword.</i></p>

Law’s costly.</p>

<p class="direction">[<i>Col. taking his Hand from the Hilt.</i></p>

<p><i>Col.</i> Well, <i>Tom</i>, you are never the
worse Man to be afraid of me. Come

born in a Wood, to be afraid of an
Owl?</p>

<p>I’ll wait on you. I hope Miss <i>Notable</i>
will be there; egad she’s very handsome,
and has Wit at Will.</p>

<p><i>Col.</i> Why every one as they like; as

<p><i>Lady Smart.</i> Oh! Colonel, are you

<p><i>Col.</i> As sure as you’re there, Madam.</p>

<p><i>Lady Smart.</i> Oh, Mr. <i>Neverout</i>! what,
such a Man alive!</p>

<p><i>Neverout.</i> Ay, Madam; alive, and alive
like to be, at your Ladyship’s Service.</p>

<p><i>Lady Smart.</i> Well: I’ll get a Knife,
and nick it down, that Mr. <i>Neverout</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
came to our House. And pray, What
News Mr. <i>Neverout</i>?</p>

<p><i>Neverout.</i> Why, Madam, Queen <i>Elizabeth</i>’s
dead.</p>

<p><i>Lady Smart.</i> Well, Mr. <i>Neverout</i>, I see
you are no Changeling.</p>

<p class="direction">[<i>Miss</i> Notable <i>comes in</i>.</p>

<p><i>Neverout.</i> Miss, your Slave: I hope
your early Rising will do you no Harm.
I hear you are but just come out of the

<p><i>Miss.</i> I always rise at Eleven, whether
it be Day or no.</p>

<p><i>Col.</i> Miss, I hope you are up for all
Day?</p>

<p><i>Miss.</i> Yes, if I don’t get a Fall before

you.</p>

<p><i>Col.</i> Pretty and well, Miss! that’s Two
very good things.</p>

<p><i>Miss.</i> I mean, I am better than I was.</p>

<p><i>Neverout.</i> Why then, ’tis well you
were sick.</p>

<p><i>Miss.</i> What, Mr. <i>Neverout</i>; you take
me up, before I’m down.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Lady Smart.</i> Come, let us leave off
Children’s Play, and come to Push-pin.</p>

<p><i>Miss</i> [<i>to Lady Smart.</i>] Pray, Madam,
give me some more Sugar to my Tea.</p>

<p><i>Col.</i> Oh! Miss, you must needs be very
good-humour’d, you love sweet things so
much.</p>

<p><i>Neverout.</i> Stir it up with the Spoon,
Miss; for the deeper the sweeter.</p>

<p><i>Lady Smart.</i> I assure you, Miss, the
Colonel has made you a great Compliment.</p>

<p><i>Miss.</i> I am sorry for it; for I have
heard say, that complimenting is lying.</p>

<p><i>Lady Smart</i> [<i>to Ld. Sparkish.</i>] My
Lord, methinks the Sight of you is good
for sore Eyes; if we had known of your
Coming, we would have strown Rushes
for you: How has your Lordship done
this long time?</p>

<p><i>Col.</i> Faith, Madam, he’s better in
Health, than in good Conditions.</p>

<p><i>Ld. Sparkish.</i> Well; I see there’s no
worse Friend than one brings from Home
with one; and I am not the first Man
has carry’d a Rod to whip himself.</p>

<p><i>Neverout.</i> Here’s Miss, has not a Word
to throw at a Dog. Come; a Penny for
your Thoughts.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Miss.</i> It is not worth a Farthing; for
I was thinking of you.</p>

<p class="direction">[<i>Col.</i>——<i>rising up.</i>——</p>

<p><i>Lady Smart.</i> Colonel, Where are you
going so soon? I hope you did not come
to fetch Fire.</p>

<p><i>Col.</i> Madam, I must needs go Home
for half an Hour.</p>

<p><i>Miss.</i> Why, Colonel, they say, the
Devil’s at Home.</p>

<p><i>Lady Answerall.</i> Well, but sit while
you stay; ’tis as cheap sitting as standing.</p>

<p><i>Col.</i> No, Madam; while I’m standing
I’m going.</p>

<p><i>Miss.</i> Nay, let him go; I promise him,
we won’t tear his Cloaths to hold him.</p>

<p><i>Lady Smart.</i> I suppose, Colonel, we
keep you from better Company; I mean
only as to myself.</p>

<p><i>Col.</i> Madam, I am all Obedience.</p>

<p class="direction">[<i>Col. sits down.</i></p>

<p><i>Lady Smart.</i> Lord, Miss, how can you
drink your Tea so hot? Sure your
Mouth’s pav’d.</p>

<p>How do you like this Tea, Colonel?</p>

<p><i>Col.</i> Well enough, Madam; but methinks
it is a little more-ish.</p>

<p><i>Lady Smart.</i> Oh, Colonel! I understand<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
you. <i>Betty</i>, bring the Canister: I
have but very little of this Tea left; but
I don’t love to make two Wants of one;
want when I have it, and want when I
have it not. He, he, he, he.</p>

<p class="direction">[<i>Laughs.</i></p>

<p><i>Lady Answ.</i> [<i>to the Maid.</i>] Why, sure,
<i>Betty</i>, you are bewitch’d; the Cream is
burnt to.</p>

<p><i>Betty.</i> Why, Madam, the Bishop has
set his Foot in it.</p>

<p><i>Lady Smart.</i> Go, you Girl, and warm
some fresh Cream.</p>

<p><i>Betty.</i> Indeed, Madam, there’s none
left; for the Cat has eaten it all.</p>

<p><i>Lady Smart.</i> I doubt, it was a Cat
with Two Legs.</p>

<p><i>Miss.</i> Colonel, Don’t you love Bread
and Butter with your Tea?</p>

<p><i>Col.</i> Yes, in a Morning, Miss: For they
say, Butter is Gold in a Morning, Silver
at Noon, but it is Lead at Night.</p>

<p><i>Neverout.</i> Miss, the Weather is so hot,
that my Butter melts on my Bread.</p>

<p><i>Lady Answ.</i> Why, Butter, I’ve heard
’em say, is mad twice a Year.</p>

<p><i>Ld. Sparkish.</i> [<i>to the Maid.</i>] Mrs. <i>Betty</i>,
how does your Body Politick?</p>

<p><i>Col.</i> Fie, my Lord; you’ll make Mrs.
<i>Betty</i> blush.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Lady Smart.</i> Blush! ay, blush like a
blue Dog.</p>

<p><i>Neverout.</i> Pray, Mrs. <i>Betty</i>, Are not
you <i>Tom Johnson</i>’s Daughter?</p>

<p><i>Betty.</i> So my Mother tells me, Sir.</p>

<p><i>Ld. Sparkish.</i> But, Mrs. <i>Betty</i>, I hear
you are in Love.</p>

<p><i>Betty.</i> My Lord, I thank God, I hate
nobody; I am in Charity with all the
World.</p>

<p><i>Lady Smart.</i> Why, Wench, I think,
thy Tongue runs upon Wheels this
Morning: How came you by that Scratch
on your Nose? Have you been fighting
with the Cats?</p>

<p><i>Col.</i> [<i>to Miss.</i>] Miss, When will you be
married?</p>

<p><i>Miss.</i> One of these Odd-come-shortly’s,
Colonel.</p>

<p><i>Neverout.</i> Yes; they say, the Match is
half made, the Spark is willing, but Miss
is not.</p>

<p><i>Miss.</i> I suppose, the Gentleman has
got his own Consent for it.</p>

<p><i>Lady Answ.</i> Pray, My Lord, did you
walk through the Park in this Rain?</p>

<p><i>Ld. Sparkish.</i> Yes, Madam; we were
neither Sugar nor Salt; we were not afraid
the Rain would melt us. He, he, he. [<i>Laugh.</i></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Col.</i> It rain’d, and the Sun shone at
the same time.</p>

<p><i>Neverout.</i> Why, then the Devil was
beating his Wife behind the Door, with
a Shoulder of Mutton. [——<i>Laugh.</i>——</p>

<p><i>Col.</i> A blind Man would be glad to
see that.</p>

<p><i>Lady Smart.</i> Mr. <i>Neverout</i>, methinks
you stand in your own Light.</p>

<p><i>Neverout.</i> Ah! Madam, I have done
so all my Life.</p>

<p><i>Ld. Sparkish.</i> I’m sure he sits in mine:
Prythee, <i>Tom</i>, sit a little farther: I believe
your Father was no Glasier.</p>

<p><i>Lady Smart.</i> Miss, dear Girl, fill me
out a Dish of Tea, for I’m very lazy.</p>

<p class="direction">[<i>Miss fills a Dish of Tea, sweetens it,
and then tastes it.</i></p>

<p><i>Lady Smart.</i> What, Miss, Will you be
my Taster?</p>

<p><i>Miss.</i> No, Madam; but, they say, ’tis
an ill Cook, that can’t lick her own
Fingers.</p>

<p><i>Neverout.</i> Pray, Miss, fill me another.</p>

<p><i>Miss.</i> Will you have it now, or stay
till you get it?</p>

<p><i>Lady Answ.</i> But, Colonel, they say,
you went to Court last Night very drunk:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
Nay, I’m told for certain, you had been
among <i>Philistines</i>: No Wonder the Cat
wink’d, when both her Eyes were out.</p>

<p><i>Col.</i> Indeed, Madam, that’s a Lye.</p>

<p><i>Lady Answ.</i> ’Tis better I should lye,
than you should lose your good Manners:
Besides, I don’t lie; I sit.</p>

<p><i>Neverout.</i> O faith, Colonel, you must
own you had a Drop in your Eye: When
I left you, you were half Seas over.</p>

<p><i>Ld. Sparkish.</i> Well, I fear, Lady <i>Answerall</i>
can’t live long, she has so much
Wit.</p>

<p><i>Neverout.</i> No; she can’t live, that’s
certain; but she may linger Thirty or
Forty Years.</p>

<p><i>Miss.</i> Live long; ay, longer than a
Cat, or a Dog, or a better thing.</p>

<p><i>Lady Answ.</i> Oh! Miss, you must give
your Vardi too!</p>

<p><i>Ld. Sparkish.</i> Miss, Shall I fill you
another Dish of Tea?</p>

<p><i>Miss.</i> Indeed, my Lord, I have drank
enough.</p>

<p><i>Ld. Sparkish.</i> Come, it will do you
more good than a Month’s Fasting;
here, take it.</p>

<p><i>Miss.</i> No, I thank your Lordship;
enough’s as good as a Feast.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Ld. Sparkish.</i> Well; but if you always
say No, you’ll never be married.</p>

<p><i>Lady Answ.</i> Do, my Lord, give her a
Dish; for, they say, Maids will say No,
and take it.</p>

<p><i>Ld. Sparkish.</i> Well; and I dare say,
Miss is a Maid in Thought, Word, and
Deed.</p>

<p><i>Neverout.</i> I would not take my Oath
of that.</p>

<p><i>Miss.</i> Pray, Sir, speak for yourself.</p>

<p><i>Lady Smart.</i> Fie, Miss; they say,
Maids should be seen, and not heard.</p>

<p><i>Lady Answ.</i> Good Miss, stir the Fire,
that the Tea-Kettle may boil.—You have
done it very well; now it burns purely.
Well, Miss, you’ll have a chearful Husband.</p>

<p><i>Miss.</i> Indeed, your Ladyship could
have stirr’d it much better.</p>

<p><i>Lady Answ.</i> I know that very well,
Hussy; but I won’t keep a Dog, and
bark myself.</p>

<p><i>Neverout.</i> What! you are sick, Miss.</p>

<p><i>Miss.</i> Not at all; for her Ladyship
meant you.</p>

<p><i>Neverout.</i> Oh! faith, Miss, you are in
Lob’s-pound; get out as you can.</p>

<p><i>Miss.</i> I won’t quarrel with my Bread<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>

I’m well.</p>

<p><i>Lady Answ.</i> Well; but Miss——</p>

<p><i>Neverout.</i> Ah! dear Madam, let the
Matter fall; take Pity on poor Miss;
don’t throw Water on a drownded Rat.</p>

<p><i>Miss.</i> Indeed, Mr. <i>Neverout</i>, you should
be cut for the Simples this Morning:
Say a Word more, and you had as good
eat your Nails.</p>

<p><i>Ld. Sparkish.</i> Pray, Miss, will you be
so good as to favour us with a Song?</p>

<p><i>Miss.</i> Indeed, my Lord, I can’t; for
I have a great Cold.</p>

<p><i>Col.</i> Oh! Miss, they say, all good
Singers have Colds.</p>

<p><i>Ld. Sparkish.</i> Pray, Madam, does not
Miss sing very well?</p>

<p><i>Lady Answ.</i> She sings, as one may
<i>say</i>, my Lord.</p>

<p><i>Miss.</i> I hear, Mr. <i>Neverout</i> has a very
good Voice.</p>

<p><i>Col.</i> Yes; <i>Tom</i> sings well; but his
Luck’s naught.</p>

<p><i>Neverout.</i> Faith, Colonel, you hit yourself
a devilish Box on the Ear.</p>

<p><i>Col.</i> Miss, Will you take a Pinch of
Snuff?</p>

<p><i>Miss.</i> No, Colonel; you must know,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
I never take Snuff, but when I’m
angry.</p>

<p><i>Lady Answ.</i> Yes, yes, she can take
Snuff; but she has never a Box to put
it in.</p>

<p><i>Miss.</i> Pray, Colonel, let me see that
Box.</p>

<p><i>Col.</i> Madam, there’s never a C upon it.</p>

<p><i>Miss.</i> May be there is, Colonel.</p>

<p><i>Col.</i> Ay; but May-bees don’t fly now,
Miss.</p>

<p><i>Neverout.</i> Colonel, why so hard upon
poor Miss? Don’t set your Wit against
a Child: Miss, give me a Blow, and I’ll
beat him.</p>

<p><i>Miss.</i> So she pray’d me to tell you.</p>

<p><i>Ld. Sparkish.</i> Pray, my Lady <i>Smart</i>,
What Kin are you to Lord <i>Pozz</i>?</p>

<p><i>Lady Smart.</i> Why, his Grandmother
and mine had Four Elbows.</p>

<p><i>Lady Answ.</i> Well, methinks here is a
silent Meeting. Come, Miss, hold up
your Head, Girl; there’s Money bid for
you.</p>

your Wit; nothing can tame you
but a Husband.</p>

<p><i>Miss.</i> Peace! I think I hear the Church
Clock.</p>

you not to cut your Fingers.</p>

their Thumbs.——</p>

<p><i>Neverout.</i> Well, Miss; tell a Mare a
Tale——</p>

<p><i>Miss.</i> I find, you love to hear yourself
talk.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Neverout.</i> Why, if you won’t hear my

<p><i>Miss.</i> Out upon you, for a filthy

<p><i>Neverout.</i> What, Miss! must I tell
you a Story, and find you Ears?</p>

<p><i>Ld. Sparkish.</i> [<i>to Lady Smart.</i>] Pray,
Madam, don’t you think Mrs. <i>Spendal</i>
very genteel?</p>

<p><i>Lady Smart.</i> Why, my Lord, I think
she was cut out for a Gentlewoman, but
she was spoil’d in the Making: She
wears her Cloaths, as if they were thrown
on her with a Pitch-Fork; and, for the
Fashion, I believe they were made in
the Reign of Queen <i>Bess</i>.</p>

<p><i>Neverout.</i> Well, that’s neither here nor
there; for you know, the more careless,
the more modish.</p>

<p><i>Col.</i> Well, I’d hold a Wager, there will
be a Match between her and <i>Dick Dolt</i>;
and I believe, I can see as far into a
Millstone as another Man.</p>

<p><i>Miss.</i> Colonel, I must beg your Pardon
a Thousand Times; but they say,
An old Ape has an old Eye.</p>

<p><i>Neverout.</i> Miss, what do you mean!
you’ll spoil the Colonel’s Marriage, if
you call him old.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Col.</i> Not so old, nor yet so cold. You
know the rest, Miss.</p>

<p><i>Miss.</i> Manners is a fine Thing, truly.</p>

<p><i>Col.</i> Faith, Miss, depend upon it, I’ll
give you as good as you bring: What!
if you give a Jest, you must take a
Jest.</p>

<p><i>Lady Smart.</i> Well, Mr. <i>Neverout</i>, you’ll
ne’er have done till you break that Knife;
and then the Man won’t take it again.</p>

<p><i>Miss.</i> Why, Madam, Fools will be
medling; I wish, he may cut his Fingers;
I hope, you can see your own
Blood without fainting.</p>

<p><i>Neverout.</i> Why, Miss, you shine this
Morning like a —— Barn-door; you’ll
never hold out at this Rate; pray, save
a little Wit for To-morrow.</p>

<p><i>Miss.</i> Well, you have said your Say;
if People will be rude, I have done; my
Comfort is, ’twill be all one a thousand
Year hence.</p>

<p><i>Neverout.</i> Miss, you have shot your
Bolt: I find, you must have the last
Word.—Well, I’ll go to the Opera To-night.—No,
I can’t neither, for I have
some Business—and yet I think I must,
for I promis’d to squire the Countess
to her Box.</p>

<p><i>Neverout.</i> Duce take you, Miss! you
trod on my Foot: I hope you don’t intend
to come to my Bedside.</p>

<p><i>Miss.</i> In Troth, you are afraid of
your Friends, and none of them near

<p><i>Ld. Sparkish.</i> Well said, Girl! [<i>giving

Chuck under the Chin is worth Two
Kisses.</p>

<p><i>Lady Answ.</i> But, Mr. <i>Neverout</i>, I wonder
why such a handsome, strait, young
Gentleman as you, do not get some rich
Widow.</p>

<p><i>Ld. Sparkish.</i> Strait! Ay, strait as my
Leg, and that’s crooked at Knee.</p>

<p><i>Neverout.</i> Faith, Madam, if it rain’d rich
Widows, none of them would fall upon
me. Egad, I was born under a Threepenny
Planet, never to be worth a Groat.</p>

<p><i>Lady Answ.</i> No, Mr. <i>Neverout</i>; I believe
you were born with a Cawl on your
Head; you are such a Favourite among
the Ladies: But what think you of
Widow <i>Prim</i>? she’s immensely rich.</p>

<p><i>Neverout.</i> Hang her! they say, her
Father was a Baker.</p>

<p><i>Lady Smart.</i> Ay; but it is not what is
she? but what has she? now-a-days.</p>

<p><i>Col.</i> <i>Tom</i>, faith, put on a bold Face
for once, and have at the Widow. I’ll
speak a good Word for you to her.</p>

<p><i>Lady Answ.</i> Ay; I warrant, you’ll
speak one Word for him, and two for
yourself.</p>

<p><i>Miss.</i> Well; I had that at my Tongue’s
End.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Lady Answ.</i> Why, Miss, they say, good
Wits jump.</p>

<p><i>Neverout.</i> Faith, Madam, I had rather
marry a Woman I lov’d, in her Smock,
than Widow <i>Prim</i>, if she had her Weight
in Gold.</p>

<p><i>Lady Smart.</i> Come, come, Mr. <i>Neverout</i>;
Marriage is honourable, but Housekeeping
is a Shrew.</p>

<p><i>Lady Answ.</i> Consider, Mr. <i>Neverout</i>,
Four bare Legs in a Bed; and you are
a younger Brother.</p>

<p><i>Col.</i> Well, Madam; the younger
Brother is the better Gentleman: However,
<i>Tom</i>, I would advise you to look
before you leap.</p>

<p><i>Ld. Sparkish.</i> The Colonel says true:
Besides, you can’t expect to wive and
thrive in the same Year.</p>

<p><i>Miss.</i> [<i>shuddering.</i>] Lord! there’s
somebody walking over my Grave.</p>

<p><i>Col.</i> Pray, Lady <i>Answerall</i>, where was
you last <i>Wednesday</i>, when I did myself
the Honour to wait on you? I think,
your Ladyship is one of the Tribe of
<i>Gad</i>.</p>

<p><i>Lady Answ.</i> Why, Colonel, I was at
Church.</p>

<p><i>Col.</i> Nay, then will I be hang’d, and
my Horse too.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Neverout.</i> I believe her Ladyship was
at a Church with a Chimney in it.</p>

<p><i>Miss.</i> Lord, my Petticoat! how it
hangs by Jommetry.</p>

<p><i>Neverout.</i> Perhaps the Fault may be
in your Shape.</p>

<p><i>Miss.</i> [<i>looking gravely.</i>] Come, Mr.
<i>Neverout</i>, there’s no Jest like the true
Jest; but, I suppose, you think my Back’s
broad enough to bear every Thing.</p>

<p><i>Neverout.</i> Madam, I humbly beg your
Pardon.</p>

<p><i>Miss.</i> Well, Sir, your Pardon’s granted.</p>

<p><i>Neverout.</i> Well, all Things have an
End, and a Pudden has two, up-up-on
my-my-my Word. [<i>stutters.</i>]</p>

<p><i>Miss.</i> What! Mr. <i>Neverout</i>, can’t you
speak without a Spoon?</p>

<p><i>Ld. Sparkish.</i> [<i>to Lady Smart.</i>] Has
your Ladyship seen the Duchess since
your falling out?</p>

<p><i>Lady Smart.</i> Never, my Lord, but
once at a Visit; and she look’d at me, as
the Devil look’d over <i>Lincoln</i>.</p>

<p><i>Neverout.</i> Pray, Miss, take a Pinch of
my Snuff.</p>

<p><i>Neverout.</i> I never said a rude Thing to

<p><i>Lady Answ.</i> Mr. <i>Neverout</i>, if Miss will
be angry for nothing, take my Council,
and bid her turn the Buckle of her Girdle

<p><i>Neverout.</i> Come, Lady <i>Answerall</i>, I
know better Things; Miss and I are good
Friends; don’t put Tricks upon Travellers.</p>

<p><i>Col.</i> <i>Tom</i>, not a Word of the Pudden,

<p><i>Miss.</i> I have a Blister on my Tongue;
yet, I don’t remember, I told a Lye.</p>

<p><i>Lady Answ.</i> I thought you did just
now.</p>

did Thought do?</p>

<p><i>Lady Answ.</i> Well, for my Life, I cannot
conceive what your Lordship means.</p>

<p><i>Ld. Sparkish.</i> Indeed, Madam, I meant
no Harm.</p>

<p><i>Lady Smart.</i> No, to be sure, my Lord!
you are as innocent as a Devil of Two
Years old.</p>

<p><i>Col.</i> Yes, Madam; but a Cup of <i>Christmas</i>
Ale will soon wash it off.</p>

<p><i>Ld. Sparkish.</i> Lady <i>Smart</i>, does not
your Ladyship think, Mrs. <i>Fade</i> is
mightily alter’d since her Marriage?</p>

<p><i>Lady Answ.</i> Why, my Lord, she was
handsome in her Time; but she cannot

she’s grown a mere Otomy.</p>

<p><i>Lady Smart.</i> Poor Creature! the Black

<p><i>Lady Smart.</i> What! Lady <i>Queasy</i>

say it upon Rep?</p>

<p><i>Neverout.</i> Poz, I saw her with my own
Eyes; she sat among the Mob in the
Gallery; her own ugly Fiz: And she saw
me look at her.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Col.</i> Her Ladyship was plaguily

<p><i>Neverout.</i> I smoked her huge Nose,
and egad she put me in mind of the

<p><i>Col.</i> <i>Tom</i>, I advise you hold your

<p><i>Miss.</i> Well; but who was your<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>

<p><i>Neverout.</i> Come then, Miss; guess
who it was that told me; come, put on

<p><i>Miss.</i> Well, who was it?</p>

<p><i>Neverout.</i> Why, one that lives within

<p><i>Miss.</i> Well, go hang yourself in your

groans for you.</p>

<p><i>Neverout.</i> Pretty Miss! I was but in Jest.</p>

<p><i>Miss.</i> Well, but don’t let that stick in
your Gizzard.</p>

<p><i>Col.</i> My Lord, does your Lordship
know Mrs. <i>Talkall</i>?</p>

<p><i>Ld. Smart.</i> Only by Sight; but I hear
she has a great deal of Wit; and egad,
as the Saying is, Mettle to the Back.</p>

<p><i>Lady Smart.</i> So I hear.</p>

<p><i>Col.</i> Why <i>Dick Lubber</i> said to her
t’other Day, Madam, you can’t cry Bo
to a Goose: Yes, but I can, said she;
and, egad, cry’d Bo full in his Face: We

<p><i>Ld. Sparkish.</i> That was cutting with

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span></p>

that Mr. <i>Buzzard</i> has married again?</p>

<p><i>Lady Smart.</i> This is his Fourth Wife;
then he has been shod round.</p>

<p><i>Col.</i> Why, you must know, she had a
Month’s Mind to <i>Dick Frontless</i>, and
thought to run away with him; but her
Parents forc’d her to take the old Fellow
for a good Settlement.</p>

<p><i>Ld. Sparkish.</i> So the Man got his
Mare again.</p>

<p><i>Ld. Smart.</i> I’m told he said a very<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
good thing to <i>Dick</i>; said he, You think
us old Fellows are Fools; but we old
Fellows know young Fellows are Fools.</p>

<p><i>Col.</i> I know nothing of that; but I
know, he’s devilish old, and she’s very
young.</p>

<p><i>Lady Answ.</i> Why, they call that a
Match of the World’s making.</p>

<p><i>Miss.</i> What if he had been young, and
she old?</p>

<p><i>Neverout.</i> Why, Miss, that would have

Goods in a Man’s House.</p>

<p><i>Lady Smart.</i> O but, Colonel, if you

that every marry’d Man should believe

one Comfort, that you need not fear a

<p><i>Ld. Sparkish.</i> Because they say, he

him so severe on all the Sex.</p>

<p><i>Lady Smart.</i> Well, but your Lordship<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
and the Colonel will dine with us To-day;
and, Mr. <i>Neverout</i>, I hope, we shall have
your good Company: There will be no
Soul else, besides my own Lord and these
Ladies; for every body knows, I hate a
Croud; I would rather want Vittles than
Elbow-Room: We dine punctually at
Three.</p>

<p><i>Ld. Sparkish.</i> Madam, we’ll be sure to
attend your Ladyship.</p>

<p><i>Col.</i> Madam, my Stomach serves me
instead of a Clock.</p>

<p class="direction">[<i>Another</i> Footman <i>comes back</i>.</p>

<p><i>Lady Smart.</i> Oh! you are the t’other
Fellow I sent: Well, have you been with
my Lady <i>Club</i>? You are good to send
of a dead Man’s Errand.</p>

<p><i>Footman.</i> Madam, my Lady <i>Club</i> begs
your Ladyship’s Pardon; but she is engaged
To-night.</p>

<p><i>Miss.</i> Well, Mr. <i>Neverout</i>, here’s the
Back of my Hand to you.</p>

<p><i>Neverout.</i> Miss, I find, you will have
the last Word. Ladies, I am more yours
than my own.</p>

<p class="center"><i>Lord</i> Smart <i>and the former Company at
Three a Clock coming to dine</i>.</p>

<p class="direction">[<i>After Salutations.</i></p>

<p><i>Lord Smart.</i> I’m sorry I was not at
Home this Morning when you all did us
the Honour to call here: But I went to
the Levee To-day.</p>

<p><i>Ld. Sparkish.</i> Oh! my Lord; I’m sure
the Loss was ours.</p>

<p><i>Lady Smart.</i> Gentlemen and Ladies,
you are come to a sad dirty House; I
am sorry for it, but we have had our
Hands in Mortar.</p>

<p><i>Ld. Sparkish.</i> Oh! Madam; your
Ladyship is pleas’d to say so, but I never
saw any thing so clean and so fine; I
profess, it is a perfect Paradise.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Lady Smart.</i> My Lord, your Lordship
is always very obliging.</p>

<p><i>Ld. Sparkish.</i> Pray, Madam, whose
Picture is that?</p>

<p><i>Lady Smart.</i> Why, my Lord, it was
drawn for me.</p>

<p><i>Ld. Sparkish.</i> I’ll swear, the Painter
did not flatter your Ladyship.</p>

<p><i>Col.</i> My Lord, the Day is finely clear’d
up.</p>

<p><i>Ld. Smart.</i> Ay, Colonel; ’tis a pity
that fair Weather should ever do any
Harm. [<i>To Neverout.</i>] Why, <i>Tom</i>, you
are high in the Mode.</p>

<p><i>Neverout.</i> My Lord, it is better be
out of the World, than out of the
Fashion.</p>

<p><i>Ld. Smart.</i> But, <i>Tom</i>, I hear, You and
Miss are always quarrelling; I fear, it is
your Fault; for I can assure you, she is
very good-humour’d.</p>

<p><i>Neverout.</i> Ay, my Lord; so is the
Devil when he’s pleas’d.</p>

<p><i>Ld. Smart.</i> Miss, what do you think of
my Friend <i>Tom</i>?</p>

<p><i>Miss.</i> My Lord, I think, he’s not the
wisest Man in the World; and truly, he’s
sometimes very rude.</p>

<p><i>Ld. Sparkish.</i> That may be true; but,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>
yet, he that hangs <i>Tom</i> for a Fool, may
find a Knave in the Halter.</p>

<p><i>Miss.</i> Well, however, I wish he were
hang’d, if it were only to try.</p>

<p><i>Neverout.</i> Well, Miss, if I must be
hang’d, I won’t go far to chuse my
Gallows; it shall be about your fair Neck.</p>

<p><i>Miss.</i> I’ll see your Nose Cheese first,
and the Dogs eating it: But, my Lord,
Mr. <i>Neverout</i>’s Wit begins to run low, for
I vow, he said this before: Pray, Colonel,
give him a Pinch, and I’ll do as much for
you.</p>

<p><i>Ld. Sparkish.</i> My Lady <i>Smart</i>, your
Ladyship has a very fine Scarf.</p>

<p><i>Lady Smart.</i> Yes, my Lord; it will
make a flaming Figure in a Country
Church.</p>

<p class="direction">[Footman <i>comes in</i>.</p>

<p><i>Footman.</i> Madam, Dinner’s upon the
Table.</p>

<p><i>Col.</i> Faith, I’m glad of it; my Belly
began to cry Cupboard.</p>

<p><i>Neverout.</i> I wish I may never hear
worse News.</p>

<p><i>Miss.</i> What! Mr. <i>Neverout</i>, you are in
great Haste; I believe, your Belly thinks
your Throat’s cut.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Neverout.</i> No, faith, Miss; Three
Meals a Day, and a good Supper at
Night, will serve my Turn.</p>

<p><i>Miss.</i> To say the Truth, I’m hungry.</p>

<p><i>Neverout.</i> And I’m angry, so let us
both go fight.</p>

<p class="direction">[<i>They go in to Dinner, and after the usual
Compliments, take their Seats.</i></p>

<p><i>Lady Smart.</i> Ladies and Gentlemen,
will you eat any Oysters before Dinner?</p>

<p><i>Col.</i> With all my Heart. [<i>Takes an
Oyster.</i>] He was a bold Man, that first
eat an Oyster.</p>

<p><i>Lady Smart.</i> They say, Oysters are a
cruel Meat, because we eat them alive:
Then they are an uncharitable Meat, for
we leave nothing to the Poor; and they
are an ungodly Meat, because we never
say Grace.</p>

<p><i>Neverout.</i> Faith, that’s as well said, as
if I had said it myself.</p>

<p><i>Lady Smart.</i> Well, we are well set, if
we be but as well serv’d: Come, Colonel,
handle your Arms; shall I help you to
some Beef?</p>

<p><i>Col.</i> If your Ladyship please; and,
pray, don’t cut like a Mother-in-Law,
but send me a large Slice; for I love to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>
lay a good Foundation. I vow, ’tis a
noble Sirloyn.</p>

<p><i>Neverout.</i> Ay; here’s cut, and come
again.</p>

<p><i>Miss.</i> But, pray, why is it call’d a Sirloyn?</p>

<p><i>Ld. Sparkish.</i> Why, you must know,
that our King <i>James</i> the First, who lov’d
good Eating, being invited to Dinner by
one of his Nobles, and seeing a large
Loyn of Beef at his Table, he drew out
his Sword, and in a Frolic knighted
it. Few People know the Secret of
this.</p>

<p><i>Ld. Sparkish.</i> Beef is Man’s Meat, my
Lord.</p>

<p><i>Ld. Smart.</i> But, my Lord, I say, Beef
is the King of Meat.</p>

<p><i>Miss.</i> Pray, what have I done, that I
must not have a Plate?</p>

<p><i>Lady Smart.</i> [<i>to Lady Answ.</i>] What
will your Ladyship please to eat?</p>

<p><i>Lady Answ.</i> Pray, Madam, help yourself.</p>

<p><i>Col.</i> They say, Eating and Scratching
wants but a Beginning: If you will give
me Leave, I’ll help myself to a Slice of
this Shoulder of Veal.</p>

<p><i>Lady Smart.</i> Colonel, you can’t do a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>
kinder thing: Well, you are all heartily
welcome, as I may say.</p>

<p><i>Col.</i> They say, there are Thirty-and-two
good Bits in a Shoulder of Veal.</p>

<p><i>Lady Smart.</i> Ay, Colonel; Thirty bad
Bits, and Two good ones: you see, I
understand you; but I hope, you have
got one of the two good ones.</p>

<p><i>Neverout.</i> Colonel, I’ll be of your
Mess.</p>

<p><i>Col.</i> Then, pray, <i>Tom</i>, carve for yourself:
They say, Two Hands in a Dish,
and One in a Purse: Hah, said I well,
<i>Tom</i>?</p>

<p><i>Neverout.</i> Colonel, you spoke like an
Oracle.</p>

<p><i>Miss.</i> [<i>to Lady Answ.</i>] Madam, will
your Ladyship help me to some Fish?</p>

<p><i>Ld. Smart.</i> [<i>to Neverout.</i>] <i>Tom</i>, they
say, Fish should swim thrice.</p>

<p><i>Neverout.</i> How is that, my Lord?</p>

<p><i>Ld. Smart.</i> Why, <i>Tom</i>, first it should
swim in the Sea, (do you mind me?) then
it should swim in Butter; and at last,
Sirrah, it should swim in good Claret. I
think, I have made it out.</p>

<p><i>Footman.</i> [<i>to Ld. Smart.</i>] My Lord,
Sir <i>John Linger</i> is coming up.</p>

<p><i>Ld. Smart.</i> God so! I invited him to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>
dine with me To-day, and forgot it:
Well, desire him to walk in.</p>

<p class="direction">[<i>Sir</i> John Linger <i>comes in</i>.</p>

<p><i>Sir John.</i> What! are you at it? Why,
then, I’ll be gone.</p>

<p><i>Lady Smart.</i> Sir <i>John</i>, I beg you will
sit down: Come, the more the merrier.</p>

<p><i>Sir John.</i> Ay; but the fewer the better
Cheer.</p>

<p><i>Lady Smart.</i> Well, I am the worst in
the World at making Apologies; it was
my Lord’s Fault: I doubt you must kiss
the Hare’s Foot.</p>

<p><i>Sir John.</i> I see you are fast by the
Teeth.</p>

<p><i>Col.</i> Faith, Sir <i>John</i>, we are killing
that, that would kill us.</p>

<p><i>Ld. Sparkish.</i> You see, Sir <i>John</i>, we
are upon a Business of Life and Death:
Come, will you do as we do? You are
come in Pudden-Time.</p>

<p><i>Sir John.</i> Ay; this would you be
doing if I were dead. What! you keep
Court-Hours I see: I’ll be going, and
get a Bit of Meat at my Inn.</p>

<p><i>Lady Smart.</i> Why, we won’t eat you,
Sir <i>John</i>.</p>

<p><i>Sir John.</i> It is my own Fault; but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>
I was kept by a Fellow who bought some
<i>Derbyshire</i> Oxen from me.</p>

<p><i>Neverout.</i> You see, Sir <i>John</i>, we stay’d
for you, as one Horse does for another.</p>

<p><i>Lady Smart.</i> My Lord, will you help
Sir <i>John</i> to some Beef? Lady <i>Answerall</i>,
pray, eat, you see your Dinner: I am sure,
if we had known we should have such
good Company, we should have been
better provided; but you must take the
Will for the Deed. I’m afraid you are
invited to your Loss.</p>

<p><i>Col.</i> And, pray, Sir <i>John</i>, how do you
like the Town? You have been absent
a long Time.</p>

<p><i>Sir John.</i> Why, I find, little <i>London</i>
stands just where it did when I left it last.</p>

<p><i>Neverout.</i> What do you think of <i>Hannover-Square</i>?
Why, Sir <i>John</i>, <i>London</i>
is gone out of Town since you saw it.</p>

<p><i>Lady Smart.</i> Sir <i>John</i>, I can only say,
you are heartily welcome; and I wish I
had something better for you.</p>

<p><i>Col.</i> Here’s no Salt; Cuckolds will run
away with the Meat.</p>

<p><i>Ld. Smart.</i> Pray, edge a little, to make
more Room for Sir <i>John</i>: Sir <i>John</i>, fall
to, you know Half an Hour is soon lost
at Dinner.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Sir John.</i> I protest I can’t eat a Bit,
for I took Share of a Beef-stake and
Two Muggs of Ale with my Chapman,
besides a Tankard of <i>March</i> Beer, as soon
as I got out of Bed.</p>

<p><i>Lady Answ.</i> Not fresh and fasting, I
hope?</p>

<p><i>Sir John.</i> Yes, faith, Madam; I always
wash my Kettle before I put the Meat
in it.</p>

<p><i>Lady Smart.</i> Poh! Sir <i>John</i>; you
have seen Nine Houses since you eat
last: Come, you have kept a Corner of
your Stomach for a Piece of Venison-Pasty.</p>

<p><i>Sir John.</i> Well, I’ll try what I can do,
when it comes up.</p>

<p><i>Lady Answ.</i> Come, Sir <i>John</i>, you may
go further, and fare worse.</p>

<p><i>Miss.</i> [<i>to Neverout.</i>] Pray, Mr. <i>Neverout</i>,
will you please to send me a Piece of
Tongue?</p>

<p><i>Neverout.</i> By no means, Madam; one
Tongue’s enough for a Woman.</p>

<p><i>Col.</i> Miss, here’s a Tongue that never
told a Lye.</p>

<p><i>Miss.</i> That was, because it could not
speak. Why, Colonel, I never told a Lye
in my Life.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Neverout.</i> I appeal to all the Company,
whether that be not the greatest Lye that
ever was told.</p>

<p><i>Col.</i> [<i>to Neverout.</i>] Pr’ythee, <i>Tom</i>, send
me the Two Legs and Rump and Liver
of that Pigeon; for, you must know, I
love what nobody else loves.</p>

<p><i>Neverout.</i> But what if any of the Ladies
should long? Well, here take it, and the
D—l do you good with it.</p>

<p><i>Lady Answ.</i> Well; this Eating and
Drinking takes away a body’s Stomach.</p>

<p><i>Neverout.</i> I am sure I have lost mine.</p>

<p><i>Miss.</i> What! the Bottom of it, I suppose.</p>

<p><i>Neverout.</i> No, really, Miss; I have
quite lost it.</p>

<p><i>Miss.</i> I should be very sorry a poor
body had found it.</p>

<p><i>Lady Smart.</i> But, Sir <i>John</i>, we hear
you are marry’d since we saw you last:
What! you have stolen a Wedding it
seems.</p>

<p><i>Sir John.</i> Well; one can’t do a foolish
thing once in one’s Life, but one must
hear of it a hundred times.</p>

<p><i>Col.</i> And pray, Sir <i>John</i>, how does
your Lady unknown?</p>

<p><i>Sir John.</i> My Wife’s well, Colonel;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>
and at your Service in a civil way. Ha,
ha. [<i>he laughs.</i></p>

<p><i>Miss.</i> Pray, Sir <i>John</i>, is your Lady tall
or short?</p>

<p><i>Sir John.</i> Why, Miss, I thank God,
she is a Little Evil.</p>

<p><i>Ld. Sparkish.</i> Come, give me a Glass
of Claret.</p>

<p class="direction">[Footman <i>fills him a Bumper</i>.</p>

<p><i>Ld. Sparkish.</i> Why do you fill so much?</p>

<p><i>Neverout.</i> My Lord, he fills as he loves
you.</p>

some Cowcomber?</p>

<p><i>Miss.</i> Madam, I dare not touch it;
for they say, Cowcombers are cold in the
third Degree.</p>

<p><i>Lady Smart.</i> Mr. <i>Neverout</i>, do you love
Pudden?</p>

<p><i>Neverout.</i> Madam, I’m like all Fools, I
love every thing that is good; but the
Proof of the Pudden is in the Eating.</p>

<p><i>Col.</i> Sir <i>John</i>, I hear you are a great
Walker when you are at Home.</p>

<p><i>Sir John.</i> No, faith, Colonel; I always
love to walk with a Horse in my Hand:
But I have had devilish bad Luck in
Horse-flesh of late.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Ld. Smart.</i> Why then, Sir <i>John</i>, you
must kiss a Parson’s Wife.</p>

<p><i>Lady Smart.</i> They say, Sir <i>John</i>, that
your Lady has a great deal of Wit.</p>

<p><i>Sir John.</i> Madam, she can make a
Pudden; and has just Wit enough to
know her Husband’s Breeches from another
Man’s.</p>

<p><i>Lady Smart.</i> My Lord <i>Sparkish</i>, I
have some excellent Cyder, will you
please to taste it?</p>

<p><i>Ld. Sparkish.</i> My Lord, I should like
it well enough, if it were not so treacherous.</p>

<p><i>Ld. Smart.</i> Pray, my Lord, how is it
treacherous?</p>

<p><i>Ld. Sparkish.</i> Because it smiles in my
Face, and cuts my Throat. [<i>Here a loud
laugh.</i>]</p>

<p><i>Miss.</i> Odd-so! Madam; your Knives
are very sharp, for I have cut my Finger.</p>

<p><i>Lady Smart.</i> I am sorry for it; pray,
which Finger? (God bless the Mark.)</p>

<p><i>Miss.</i> Why, this Finger: No, ’tis this:
I vow I can’t find which it is.</p>

<p><i>Neverout.</i> Ay; the Fox had a Wound,
and he could not tell where, <i>&amp;c.</i> Bring
some Water to throw in her Face.</p>

<p><i>Miss.</i> Pray, Mr. <i>Neverout</i>, did you ever<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>
draw a Sword in Anger? I warrant you
would faint at the Sight of your own
Blood.</p>

<p><i>Lady Smart.</i> Mr. <i>Neverout</i>, shall I send
you some Veal?</p>

<p><i>Neverout.</i> No, Madam; I don’t love it.</p>

<p><i>Miss.</i> Then pray for them that do. I
desire your Ladyship will send me a Bit.</p>

myself the Honour to drink to your Lordship.</p>

<p><i>Ld. Smart.</i> Why then that’s <i>Hartfordshire</i>
Kindness.</p>

<p><i>Neverout.</i> Faith, my Lord, I pledged
myself, for I drank twice together without
thinking.</p>

<p><i>Ld. Sparkish.</i> Why then, Colonel, my
humble Service to You.</p>

<p><i>Neverout.</i> Pray, my Lord, don’t make
a Bridge of my Nose.</p>

<p><i>Ld. Sparkish.</i> Well, a Glass of this
Wine is as comfortable as Matrimony to

speak in my Tip.</p>

<p><i>Col.</i> Well, he was an ingenious Man,
that first found out Eating and Drinking.</p>

<p><i>Ld. Sparkish.</i> Of all Vittles Drink
digests the quickest: Give me a Glass
of Wine.</p>

<p><i>Neverout.</i> My Lord, your Wine is too
strong.</p>

<p><i>Ld. Smart.</i> Ay, <i>Tom</i>; as much as
you are too good.</p>

<p><i>Miss.</i> This Almond Pudden was pure
good; but it is grown quite cold.</p>

<p><i>Neverout.</i> So much the better, Miss;
cold Pudden will settle your Love.</p>

<p><i>Miss.</i> Pray, Mr. <i>Neverout</i>, are you
going to take a Voyage?</p>

<p><i>Neverout.</i> Why do you ask, Miss?</p>

<p><i>Miss.</i> Because you have laid in so
much Beef.</p>

<p><i>Sir John.</i> You Two have eat up the
whole Pudden betwixt you.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Miss.</i> Sir <i>John</i>, here’s a little Bit left;
will you please to have it?</p>

<p><i>Sir John.</i> No, thankee; I don’t love
to make a Fool of my Mouth.</p>

<p><i>Col.</i> [<i>calling to the Butler.</i>] <i>John</i>, is your
Small Beer good?</p>

<p><i>Butler.</i> An please your Honour, my
Lord and Lady like it; I think it is good.</p>

<p><i>Col.</i> Why then, <i>John</i>, d’yesee? if you
are sure your Small Beer is good, d’yemark?
Then, give me a Glass of Wine.</p>

<p class="direction">[<i>Colonel tasting the Wine.</i></p>

<p><i>Ld. Smart.</i> Sir <i>John</i>, how does your
Neighbour <i>Gatherall</i> of the <i>Peak</i>? I hear,
he has lately made a Purchase.</p>

<p><i>Sir John.</i> Oh, <i>Dick Gatherall</i> knows
how to butter his Bread, as well as any
Man in <i>Darbyshire</i>.</p>

<p><i>Ld. Smart.</i> Why, he us’d to go very
fine, when he was here in Town.</p>

<p><i>Sir John.</i> Ay; and it became him, as
a Saddle becomes a Sow.</p>

<p><i>Col.</i> I know his Lady, and I think she
is a very good Woman.</p>

<p><i>Sir John.</i> Faith, she has more Goodness

his whole Body.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Ld. Smart.</i> Well, Colonel, how do you
like that Wine?</p>

<p><i>Col.</i> This Wine should be eaten; it is
too good to be drunk.</p>

<p><i>Ld. Smart.</i> I’m very glad you like it;
and pray don’t spare it.</p>

<p><i>Col.</i> No, my Lord; I’ll never starve
in a Cook’s Shop.</p>

<p><i>Ld. Smart.</i> And pray, Sir <i>John</i>, what
do You say to my Wine?</p>

<p><i>Sir John.</i> I’ll take another Glass first;
second Thoughts are best.</p>

<p><i>Ld. Sparkish.</i> Pray, Lady <i>Smart</i>, you
sit near that Ham; will you please to
send me a Bit?</p>

<p><i>Lady Smart.</i> With all my Heart. [<i>She
sends him a Piece.</i>] Pray, my Lord, how
do you like it?</p>

<p><i>Ld. Sparkish.</i> I think it is a Limb of <i>Lot</i>’s
Wife. [<i>He eats it with Mustard.</i>] Egad,
my Lord, your Mustard is very uncivil.</p>

<p><i>Ld. Smart.</i> Why uncivil, my Lord?</p>

<p><i>Ld. Sparkish.</i> Because it takes me by
the Nose, egad.</p>

<p><i>Lady Smart.</i> Mr. <i>Neverout</i>, I find you

<p><i>Lady Answ.</i> No, no; throw a little

<p><i>Miss.</i> What! you don’t know your

<p><i>Neverout.</i> Ay, one of the Enough’s; I

<p><i>Neverout</i> [<i>to Lady Answ.</i>] Madam, I

<p><i>Lady Answ.</i> Well, Mr. <i>Neverout</i>, I find

Well, God sends Meat, but the Devil

<p><i>Neverout.</i> Miss, can you tell which is
the white Goose, or the gray Goose the

<p><i>Miss.</i> They say, a Fool will ask more
Questions than the wisest body can

<p><i>Col.</i> Indeed, Miss, <i>Tom Neverout</i> has

<p><i>Miss.</i> Why, Colonel, every Dog has

a Goose again without thinking on Mr.

<p><i>Lady Answ.</i> Oh, Miss! the World’s a

<p><i>Neverout.</i> Well, Miss, I’ll give you
Leave to call me any thing, if you don’t
call me Spade.</p>

<p><i>Ld. Smart.</i> Well, but, after all, <i>Tom</i>,
can you tell me what’s <i>Latin</i> for a Goose.</p>

<p><i>Neverout.</i> O my Lord, I know that;
why <i>Brandy</i> is <i>Latin</i> for a Goose, and
<i>Tace</i> is <i>Latin</i> for a Candle.</p>

<p><i>Miss.</i> Is that Manners, to shew your
Learning before Ladies? Methinks you
are grown very brisk of a sudden; I
think the Man’s glad he’s alive.</p>

<p><i>Sir John.</i> The Devil take your Wit, if
this be Wit; for it spoils Company:
Pray, Mr. <i>Butler</i>, bring me a Dram after
my Goose; ’tis very good for the Wholsoms.</p>

<p><i>Ld. Smart.</i> Come, bring me the Loaf;

<p><i>Neverout.</i> I will.</p>

<p><i>Neverout.</i> Yes, Madam; I went the

<p><i>Lady Smart.</i> Well; and how did it

<p><i>Neverout.</i> Why, Madam, the Poet is

<p><i>Sir John.</i> God forgive you! that’s very

rashly of any Christian.</p>

<p><i>Neverout</i> [<i>whispers Lady Smart.</i>] Was

<p><i>Sir John.</i> Hopt! why, if it had hopp’d

Drink and Cloth; it will make a Cat
speak, and a wise Man dumb.</p>

<p><i>Lady Smart.</i> I was told, ours was very
strong.</p>

<p><i>Sir John.</i> Ay, Madam, strong of the
Water; I believe the Brewer forgot the
Malt, or the River was too near him:
Faith, it is mere Whip-Belly-Vengeance;
he that drinks most has the worst Share.</p>

<p><i>Col.</i> I believe, Sir <i>John</i>, Ale is as
Plenty as Water at your House.</p>

<p><i>Sir John.</i> Why, faith, at <i>Christmas</i> we

<p><i>Sir John.</i> O Madam; you are pleased
to say so.</p>

<p><i>Lady Smart.</i> But, Sir <i>John</i>, your Ale
is terrible strong and heady in <i>Derbyshire</i>,
and will soon make one drunk and
sick; what do you then?</p>

<p><i>Sir John.</i> Why, indeed, it is apt to
fox one; but our Way is, to take a Hair
of the same Dog next Morning.——I
take a new-laid Egg for Breakfast; and,
faith, one should drink as much after an
Egg as after an Ox.</p>

<p><i>Ld. Smart.</i> <i>Tom Neverout</i>, will you

<p><i>Neverout.</i> No, faith, my Lord; I like

<p><i>Lady Smart.</i> None, Sir <i>John</i>, but to
take Care of Yourself; and my most
humble Service to your Lady unknown.</p>

<p><i>Sir John.</i> Well, Madam, I can but love
and thank you.</p>

<p><i>Lady Smart.</i> Here, bring Water to
wash; tho’, really, you have all eaten so<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span>
little, that you have no need to wash
your Mouths.——</p>

<p><i>Ld. Smart.</i> But, pr’ythee, Sir <i>John</i>,
stay awhile longer.</p>

<p><i>Sir John.</i> No, my Lord; I am to
smoke a Pipe with a Friend before I
leave the Town.</p>

<p><i>Col.</i> Why, Sir <i>John</i>, had not you better
set out To-morrow?</p>

<p><i>Sir John.</i> Colonel, you forget To-morrow
is <i>Sunday</i>.</p>

<p><i>Col.</i> Now I always love to begin a
Journey on <i>Sundays</i>, because I shall have
the Prayers of the Church, to preserve
all that travel by Land, or by Water.</p>

<p><i>Sir John.</i> Well, Colonel; thou art a
mad Fellow to make a Priest of.</p>

<p><i>Neverout.</i> Fie, Sir <i>John</i>, do you take
Tobacco? How can you make a Chimney
of your Mouth?</p>

<p><i>Sir John</i> [<i>to Neverout.</i>] What! you
don’t smoke, I warrant you, but you
smock. (Ladies, I beg your Pardon.)
Colonel, do you never smoke?</p>

<p><i>Col.</i> No, Sir <i>John</i>; but I take a Pipe
sometimes.</p>

<p><i>Sir John.</i> I’faith, one of your finical
<i>London</i> Blades dined with me last Year
in <i>Darbyshire</i>; so, after Dinner, I took<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span>
a Pipe; so my Gentleman turn’d away
his Head: So, said I, What, Sir, do you
never smoke? So, he answered as you
do, Colonel; No, but I sometimes take
a Pipe: So, he took a Pipe in his Hand,
and fiddled with it till he broke it: So,
said I, Pray, Sir, can you make a Pipe?
So, he said No; so, said I, Why,
then, Sir, if you can’t make a Pipe, you
should not break a Pipe; so, we all
laugh’d.</p>

<p><i>Ld. Smart.</i> Well; but, Sir <i>John</i>, they
say, that the Corruption of Pipes is the
Generation of Stoppers.</p>

<p><i>Sir John.</i> Colonel, I hear, you go
sometimes to <i>Darbyshire</i>; I wish you
would come and foul a Plate with me.</p>

<p><i>Col.</i> I hope, you’ll give me a Soldier’s
Bottle.</p>

<p><i>Sir John.</i> Come, and try. Mr. <i>Neverout</i>,
you are a Town-Wit, can you tell
me what kind of Herb is Tobacco?</p>

<p><i>Neverout.</i> Why, an <i>Indian</i> Herb, Sir
<i>John</i>.</p>

<p><i>Sir John.</i> No,’tis a Pot Herb; and so
here’s t’ye in a Pot of my Lord’s <i>October</i>.</p>

<p><i>Lady Smart.</i> I hear, Sir <i>John</i>, since
you are married, you have forsworn the
Town.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Sir John.</i> No, Madam; I never forswore
any thing but building of Churches.</p>

<p><i>Lady Smart.</i> Well; but, Sir <i>John</i>,
when may we hope to see you again in
<i>London</i>?</p>

<p><i>Sir John.</i> Why, Madam, not till the
Ducks have eat up the Dirt; as the
Children say.</p>

<p><i>Neverout.</i> Come, Sir <i>John</i>; I foresee
it will rain terribly.</p>

<p><i>Lady Smart.</i> Come, Sir <i>John</i>, do
nothing rashly; let us drink first.</p>

<p><i>Ld. Sparkish.</i> I know Sir <i>John</i> will go,
tho’ he was sure it would rain Cats and
Dogs: But pray, stay, Sir <i>John</i>; you’ll
be time enough to go to Bed by Candle-light.</p>

<p><i>Ld. Smart.</i> Why, Sir <i>John</i>, if you
must needs go; while you stay, make
good Use of your Time: Here’s my Service
to you, a Health to our Friends in
<i>Darbyshire</i>: Come, sit down; let us put
off the evil Hour as long as we can.</p>

<p><i>Sir John.</i> Faith, I could not drink a
Drop more, if the House was full.</p>

<p><i>Col.</i> Why, Sir <i>John</i>, you used to love
a Glass of good Wine in former Times.</p>

<p><i>Sir John.</i> Why, so I do still, Colonel;
but a Man may love his House very<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span>
well, without riding on the Ridge: Besides,
I must be with my Wife on <i>Tuesday</i>,
or there will be the Devil and all to
pay.</p>

<p><i>Col.</i> Well, if you go To-day, I wish
you may be wet to the Skin.</p>

<p><i>Sir John.</i> Ay; but they say, the
Prayers of the Wicked won’t prevail.</p>

<p class="direction">[Sir John <i>takes Leave, and goes away</i>.</p>

<p><i>Ld. Smart.</i> Well, Miss, how do you
like Sir <i>John</i>?</p>

<p><i>Miss.</i> Why, I think, he’s a little upon
the silly, or so: I believe, he has not all
the Wit in the World; but I don’t pretend
to be a Judge.</p>

<p><i>Neverout.</i> Faith, I believe, he was bred
at <i>Hogs-Norton</i>, where the Pigs play
upon the Organs.</p>

<p><i>Ld. Sparkish.</i> Why, <i>Tom</i>, I thought
You and He were Hand and Glove.</p>

<p><i>Neverout.</i> Faith, he shall have a clean
Threshold for me; I never darkned his
Door in my Life, neither in Town nor
Country; but he’s a quere old Duke by
my Conscience; and yet, after all, I take
him to be more Knave than Fool.</p>

<p><i>Lady Smart.</i> Well, come; a Man’s a
Man, if he has but a Nose on his Head.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Col.</i> I was once with Him and some
other Company over a Bottle; and, egad,
he fell asleep, and snor’d so hard, that
we thought he was driving his Hogs to
Market.</p>

<p><i>Neverout.</i> Why, what! you can have
no more of a Cat than her Skin; you
can’t make a Silk Purse out of a Sow’s
Ear.</p>

<p><i>Ld. Sparkish.</i> Well, since he’s gone,
the Devil go with him and Sixpence;
and there’s Money and Company too.</p>

<p><i>Neverout.</i> Faith, he’s a true Country
Put. Pray, Miss, let me ask you a Question?</p>

<p><i>Miss.</i> Well; but don’t ask Questions
with a dirty Face: I warrant, what you
have to say will keep cold.</p>

<p><i>Col.</i> Come, my Lord, against you are
disposed; Here’s to all that love and
honour you.</p>

<p><i>Ld. Sparkish.</i> Ay, that was always
<i>Dick Nimble</i>’s Health. I’m sure you
know he’s dead.</p>

<p><i>Col.</i> Dead! Well, my Lord, you love to
be a Messenger of ill News: I’m heartily
sorry; but, my Lord, we must all die.</p>

<p><i>Neverout.</i> I knew him very well: But,
pray, how came he to die?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Miss.</i> There’s a Question! you talk
like a Poticary: Why, because he could
live no longer.</p>

<p><i>Neverout.</i> Well; rest his Soul: We
must live by the Living, and not by the
Dead.</p>

<p><i>Ld. Sparkish.</i> You know, his House
was burnt down to the Ground.</p>

<p><i>Col.</i> Yes; it was in the News: Why
Fire and Water are good Servants, but
they are very bad Masters.</p>

<p><i>Ld. Smart.</i> Here, take away, and set
down a Bottle of <i>Burgundy</i>: Ladies,
you’ll stay, and drink a Glass of Wine
before you go to your Tea.</p>

<p class="direction">[<i>All taken away, and the Wine set

<p><i>Neverout.</i> Pray, Miss, where did you
get that Pick-Tooth Case?</p>

<p><i>Miss.</i> I came honestly by it.</p>

<p><i>Neverout.</i> I’m sure it was mine, for I
lost just such a one; nay, I don’t tell you
a Lye.</p>

<p><i>Miss.</i> No; if You lye, it is much.</p>

<p><i>Neverout.</i> Well; I’m sure ’tis mine.</p>

<p><i>Miss.</i> What! you think every Thing
is yours, but a little the King has.</p>

<p><i>Neverout.</i> Colonel, you have seen my
fine Pick-Tooth Case; don’t you think
this is the very same?</p>

<p><i>Col.</i> Indeed, Miss, it is very like it.</p>

<p><i>Miss.</i> Ay; what he says, you’ll swear.</p>

<p><i>Neverout.</i> Well; but I’ll prove it to
be mine.</p>

<p><i>Miss.</i> Ay; do if you can.</p>

<p><i>Lady Smart.</i> Mr. <i>Neverout</i>, my Lord

<span class="smaller">DIALOGUE III.</span></h2>

<p class="center"><i>The Ladies at their Tea.</i></p>

<p><i>Lady Smart.</i> Well, Ladies; now let
us have a Cup of Discourse to ourselves.</p>

<p><i>Lady Answ.</i> What do you think of
your Friend, Sir <i>John Spendall</i>?</p>

<p><i>Lady Smart.</i> Why, Madam,’tis happy
for him, that his Father was born before
him.</p>

<p><i>Miss.</i> They say, he makes a very ill
Husband to my Lady.</p>

<p><i>Lady Answ.</i> But he must be allow’d
to be the fondest Father in the World.</p>

<p><i>Lady Smart.</i> Ay, Madam, that’s true;
for they say, the Devil is kind to his
own.</p>

<p><i>Miss.</i> I am told, my Lady manages
him to Admiration.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Lady Smart.</i> That I believe; for she’s
as cunning as a dead Pig; but not half
so honest.</p>

<p><i>Lady Answ.</i> They say, she’s quite a
Stranger to all his Gallantries.</p>

<p><i>Lady Smart.</i> Not at all; but, you
know, there’s none so blind as they that
won’t see.</p>

<p><i>Miss.</i> O Madam, I am told, she
watches him, as a Cat would watch a
Mouse.</p>

<p><i>Lady Answ.</i> Well, if she ben’t foully
belied, she pays him in his own Coin.</p>

<p><i>Lady Smart.</i> Madam, I fancy I know
your Thoughts, as well as if I were within
you.</p>

<p><i>Lady Answ.</i> Madam, I was t’other
Day in Company with Mrs. <i>Clatter</i>; I
find she gives herself Airs of being acquainted
with your Ladyship.</p>

<p><i>Miss.</i> Oh, the hideous Creature! did
you observe her Nails? they were long
enough to scratch her Granum out of her
Grave.</p>

<p><i>Lady Smart.</i> Well, She and <i>Tom Gosling</i>
were banging Compliments backwards
and forwards; it look’d like Two
Asses scrubbing one another.</p>

<p><i>Miss.</i> Ay, claw me, and I’ll claw thou:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span>
But, pray, Madam; who were the Company?</p>

<p><i>Lady Smart.</i> Why, there was all the
World, and his Wife; there was Mrs.
<i>Clatter</i>, Lady <i>Singular</i>, the Countess of
<i>Talkham</i>, (I should have named her
first;) <i>Tom Goslin</i>, and some others,
whom I have forgot.</p>

<p><i>Lady Answ.</i> I think the Countess is
very sickly.</p>

<p><i>Lady Smart.</i> Yes, Madam; she’ll
never scratch a grey Head, I promise
her.</p>

<p><i>Miss.</i> And, pray, what was your Conversation?</p>

<p><i>Lady Smart.</i> Why, Mrs. <i>Clatter</i> had
all the Talk to herself, and was perpetually
complaining of her Misfortunes.</p>

<p><i>Lady Answ.</i> She brought her Husband
Ten Thousand Pounds; she has a Town-House
and Country-house: Would the
Woman have her —— hung with
Points?</p>

<p><i>Lady Smart.</i> She would fain be at
the Top of the House before the Stairs
are built.</p>

<p><i>Miss.</i> Well, Comparisons are odious;
but she’s as like her Husband, as if she
were spit out of his Mouth; as like as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span>
one Egg is to another: Pray, how was
she drest?</p>

<p><i>Lady Smart.</i> Why, she was as fine as
Fi’pence; but, truly, I thought, there
was more Cost than Worship.</p>

<p><i>Lady Answ.</i> I don’t know her Husband:
Pray, what is he?</p>

<p><i>Lady Smart.</i> Why, he’s a Concealer
of the Law; you must know, he came to
us as drunk as <i>David</i>’s Sow.</p>

<p><i>Miss.</i> What kind of Creature is he?</p>

<p><i>Lady Smart.</i> You must know, the
Man and his Wife are coupled like Rabbets,
a fat and a lean; he’s as fat as a
Porpus, and she’s one of <i>Pharaoh</i>’s lean
Kine: The Ladies and <i>Tom Gosling</i> were
proposing a Party at Quadrille, but he
refus’d to make one: Damn your Cards,
said he, they are the Devil’s Books.</p>

<p><i>Lady Answ.</i> A dull unmannerly Brute!
Well, God send him more Wit, and me
more Money.</p>

<p><i>Miss.</i> Lord! Madam, I would not
keep such Company for the World.</p>

<p><i>Lady Smart.</i> O Miss, ’tis nothing
when you are used to it: Besides, you
know, for Want of Company, welcome
Trumpery.</p>

<p><i>Miss.</i> Did your Ladyship play?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Lady Smart.</i> Yes, and won; so I
came off with Fidlers Fare, Meat, Drink,
and Money.</p>

<p><i>Lady Answ.</i> Ay; what says <i>Pluck</i>?</p>

<p><i>Miss.</i> Well, my Elbow itches; I shall
change Bed-fellows.</p>

<p><i>Lady Smart.</i> And my Right Hand
itches; I shall receive Money.</p>

<p><i>Lady Answ.</i> And my Right Eye
itches; I shall cry.</p>

<p><i>Lady Smart.</i> Miss, I hear your Friend
Mistress <i>Giddy</i> has discarded <i>Dick
Shuttle</i>: Pray, has she got another
Lover?</p>

<p><i>Miss.</i> I hear of none.</p>

<p><i>Lady Smart.</i> Why, the Fellow’s rich;
and I think she was a Fool to throw out
her dirty Water before she got clean.</p>

<p><i>Lady Answ.</i> Miss, that’s a very handsome
Gown of yours, and finely made;
very genteel.</p>

<p><i>Miss.</i> I’m glad your Ladyship likes
it.</p>

<p><i>Lady Answ.</i> Your Lover will be in
Raptures; it becomes you admirably.</p>

<p><i>Miss.</i> Ay; I assure you I won’t take
it as I have done; if this won’t fetch
him, the Devil fetch him, say I.</p>

<p><i>Lady Smart</i> [<i>to Lady Answ.</i>] Pray,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span>
Madam, when did you see Sir <i>Peter
Muckworm</i>?</p>

<p><i>Lady Answ.</i> Not this Fortnight; I
hear, he’s laid up with the Gout.</p>

<p><i>Lady Smart.</i> What does he do for it?</p>

<p><i>Lady Answ.</i> Why I hear he’s weary
of doctoring it, and now makes Use of
nothing but Patience and Flannel.</p>

<p><i>Miss.</i> Pray, how does He and my
Lady agree?</p>

<p><i>Lady Answ.</i> You know, he loves her
as the Devil loves Holy Water.</p>

<p><i>Miss.</i> They say, she plays deep with
Sharpers, that cheat her of her Money.</p>

<p><i>Lady Answ.</i> Upon my Word, they
must rise early that would cheat her
of her Money; Sharp’s the Word with
her; Diamonds cut Diamonds.</p>

<p><i>Miss.</i> Well, but I was assur’d from a
good Hand that she lost at one Sitting
to the Tune of a hundred Guineas; make
Money of that.</p>

<p><i>Lady Smart.</i> Well, but do you hear,
that Mrs. <i>Plump</i> is brought to Bed at
last?</p>

<p><i>Miss.</i> And, pray, what has God sent
her?</p>

<p><i>Lady Smart.</i> Why, guess, if you can.</p>

<p><i>Miss.</i> A Boy, I suppose.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Lady Smart.</i> No, you are out; guess
again.</p>

<p><i>Miss.</i> A Girl then.</p>

<p><i>Lady Smart.</i> You have hit it; I believe
you are a Witch.</p>

<p><i>Miss.</i> O Madam; the Gentlemen say,
all fine Ladies are Witches; but I pretend
to no such thing.</p>

<p><i>Lady Answ.</i> Well, she had good Luck
to draw <i>Tom Plump</i> into Wedlock; she
ris’ with her —— upwards.</p>

<p><i>Miss.</i> Fie, Madam! what do you
mean?</p>

<p><i>Lady Smart.</i> O Miss; ’tis nothing
what we say among ourselves.</p>

<p><i>Miss.</i> Ay, Madam; but they say,
Hedges have Eyes, and Walls have
Ears.</p>

<p><i>Lady Answ.</i> Well, Miss, I can’t help
it; you know, I am old Tell-Truth; I
love to call a Spade a Spade.</p>

<p><i>Lady Smart</i> [<i>mistakes the Tea-tongs
for the Spoon.</i>] What! I think my
Wits are a Wool-gathering To-day.</p>

<p><i>Miss.</i> Why, Madam, there was but a
Right and a Wrong.</p>

<p><i>Lady Smart.</i> Miss, I hear, that You
and Lady <i>Coupler</i> are as great as Cup
and Can.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Lady Answ.</i> Ay, Miss; as great as
the Devil and the Earl of <i>Kent</i>.</p>

<p><i>Lady Smart.</i> Nay, I am told, you
meet together with as much Love, as
there is between the old Cow and the
Hay-stack.</p>

<p><i>Miss.</i> I own, I love her very well; but
there’s Difference betwixt staring and
stark mad.</p>

<p><i>Lady Smart.</i> They say, she begins to
grow fat.</p>

<p><i>Miss.</i> Fat! ay, fat as a Hen in the
Forehead.</p>

<p><i>Lady Smart.</i> Indeed, Lady <i>Answerall</i>,
(pray, forgive me) I think, your Ladyship
looks thinner than when I saw you
last.</p>

<p><i>Miss.</i> Indeed, Madam, I think not;
but your Ladyship is one of <i>Job</i>’s Comforters.</p>

<p><i>Lady Answ.</i> Well, no matter how I
look; I am bought and sold: but really,
Miss, you are so very obliging, that I
wish I were a handsome young Lord for
your Sake.</p>

<p><i>Miss.</i> O Madam, your Love’s a Million.</p>

<p><i>Lady Smart</i> [<i>to Lady Answ.</i>] Madam,
will your Ladyship let me wait on you
to the Play To-morrow?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Lady Answ.</i> Madam, it becomes me
to wait on your Ladyship.</p>

<p><i>Miss.</i> What, then, I’m turn’d out for
a Wrangler.</p>

<p class="direction">[<i>The Gentlemen come in to the Ladies to

<p><i>Miss.</i> Mr. <i>Neverout</i>, we wanted you
sadly; you are always out of the Way
when you should be hang’d.</p>

<p><i>Neverout.</i> You wanted me! Pray,
Miss, how do you look when you lye?</p>

<p><i>Miss.</i> Better than you when you cry.
Manners indeed! I find, you mend like
sour Ale in Summer.</p>

<p><i>Neverout.</i> I beg your Pardon, Miss;
I only meant, when you lie alone.</p>

<p><i>Miss.</i> That’s well turn’d; one Turn
more would have turn’d you down
Stairs.</p>

<p><i>Neverout.</i> Come, Miss; be kind for
once, and order me a Dish of Coffee.</p>

<p><i>Miss.</i> Pray, go yourself; let us wear
out the oldest first: Besides, I can’t go,
for I have a Bone in my Leg.</p>

<p><i>Col.</i> They say, a Woman need but
look on her Apron-string to find an
Excuse.</p>

<p><i>Neverout.</i> Why, Miss, you are grown<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span>
so peevish, a Dog would not live with
you.</p>

<p><i>Miss.</i> Mr. <i>Neverout</i>, I beg your Diversion;
no Offence, I hope: but truly in a
little time you intend to make the
Colonel as bad as yourself; and that’s as
bad as bad can.</p>

<p><i>Neverout.</i> My Lord, don’t you think
Miss improves wonderfully of late? Why,
Miss, if I spoil the Colonel, I hope you
will use him as you do me; for, you
know, love me, love my Dog.</p>

<p><i>Col.</i> How’s that, <i>Tom</i>? Say that
again: Why, if I am a Dog, shake
Hands, Brother.</p>

<p class="direction">[<i>Here a great, loud, long Laugh.</i></p>

You, I’ll come and drink Tea with
you in the Morning.</p>

<p><i>Miss.</i> Colonel, there’s Two Words to
that Bargain.</p>

<p><i>Col.</i> [<i>to Lady Smart.</i>] Your Ladyship
has a very fine Watch; well may you
wear it.</p>

<p><i>Lady Smart.</i> It is none of mine,
Colonel.</p>

<p><i>Col.</i> Pray, whose is it then?</p>

<p><i>Lady Smart.</i> Why, ’tis my Lord’s;
for they say, a marry’d Woman has
nothing of her own, but her Wedding-Ring
and her Hair-Lace: But if Women
had been the Law-Makers, it would have

<p><i>Col.</i> This Watch seems to be quite
new.</p>

<p><i>Lady Smart.</i> No, Sir; it has been
Twenty Years in my Lord’s Family; but
<i>Quare</i> put a new Case and Dial-Plate to it.</p>

<p><i>Neverout.</i> Why, that’s for all the World
like the Man who swore he kept the same
Knife forty Years, only he sometimes
changed the Haft, and sometimes the
Blade.</p>

<p><i>Ld. Smart.</i> Well, <i>Tom</i>, to give the
Devil his Due, thou art a right Woman’s
Man.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Col.</i> Odd-so! I have broke the Hinge
of my Snuff-box; I’m undone beside the
Loss.</p>

<p><i>Miss.</i> Alack-a-day, Colonel! I vow I
had rather have found Forty Shillings.</p>

<p><i>Neverout.</i> Why, Colonel; all that I
can say to comfort you, is, that you must
mend it with a new one.</p>

<p class="direction">[Miss <i>laughs</i>.</p>

<p><i>Col.</i> What, Miss! you can’t laugh, but
you must shew your Teeth.</p>

<p><i>Miss.</i> I’m sure you shew your Teeth
when you can’t bite: Well, thus it must
be, if we sell Ale.</p>

<p><i>Neverout.</i> Miss, you smell very sweet;
I hope you don’t carry Perfumes.</p>

<p><i>Miss.</i> Perfumes! No, Sir; I’d have
you to know, it is nothing but the Grain
of my Skin.</p>

<p><i>Col.</i> <i>Tom</i>, you have a good Nose to
make a poor Man’s Sow.</p>

<p><i>Ld. Sparkish.</i> So, Ladies and Gentlemen,
methinks you are very witty upon
one another: Come, box it about; ’twill
come to my Father at last.</p>

<p><i>Col.</i> Why, my Lord, you see Miss has
no Mercy; I wish she were marry’d;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span>
but I doubt, the grey Mare would prove
the better Horse.</p>

<p><i>Miss.</i> Well, God forgive you for that
Wish.</p>

<p><i>Ld. Sparkish.</i> Never fear him, Miss.</p>

<p><i>Miss.</i> What, my Lord, do you think I
was born in a Wood, to be afraid of an
Owl?</p>

<p><i>Ld. Smart.</i> What have you to say to
that, Colonel?</p>

<p><i>Neverout.</i> O my Lord, my Friend the
Colonel scorns to set his Wit against a
Child.</p>

<p><i>Miss.</i> Scornful Dogs will eat dirty
Puddens.</p>

<p><i>Col.</i> Well, Miss; they say, a Woman’s
Tongue is the last thing about her that
dies; therefore let’s kiss and Friends.</p>

<p><i>Miss.</i> Hands off! that’s Meat for your
Master.</p>

<p><i>Ld. Sparkish.</i> Faith, Colonel, you are
for Ale and Cakes: But after all, Miss,
you are too severe; you would not meddle
with your Match.</p>

<p><i>Miss.</i> All they can say goes in at one
Ear, and out at t’other for me, I can
assure you: Only I wish they would be
quiet, and let me drink my Tea.</p>

<p><i>Neverout.</i> What! I warrant you think<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span>
all is lost, that goes beside your own
Mouth.</p>

<p><i>Miss.</i> Pray, Mr. <i>Neverout</i>, hold your
Tongue for once, if it be possible; one
would think, you were a Woman in Man’s
Cloaths, by your prating.</p>

<p><i>Neverout.</i> No, Miss; it is not handsome
to see one hold one’s Tongue:
Besides, I should slobber my Fingers.</p>

<p><i>Col.</i> Miss, did you never hear, that
Three Women and a Goose are enough
to make a Market?</p>

<p><i>Miss.</i> I’m sure, if Mr. <i>Neverout</i> or You
were among them, it would make a Fair.</p>

<p class="direction">[Footman <i>comes in</i>.</p>

<p><i>Lady Smart.</i> Here, take away the
Tea-table, and bring up Candles.</p>

<p><i>Lady Answ.</i> O Madam, no Candles
yet, I beseech you; don’t let us burn
Day-Light.</p>

<p><i>Neverout.</i> I dare swear, Miss, for her
Part, will never burn Day-Light, if she
can help it.</p>

<p><i>Miss.</i> Lord, Mr. <i>Neverout</i>, one can’t
hear one’s own Ears for you.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span></p>

kiss where we like best.</p>

<p><i>Miss.</i> Fogh! these Men talk of nothing
but kissing.</p>

<p class="direction">[<i>She spits.</i></p>

<p><i>Neverout.</i> What, Miss, does it make
your Mouth water?</p>

<p><i>Lady Smart.</i> It is as good be in the
Dark as without Light; therefore pray
bring in Candles: They say, Women

Come, Gentlemen, are you for a Party at
Quadrille?</p>

<p><i>Col.</i> I’ll make one with you three
Ladies.</p>

<p><i>Lady Answ.</i> I’ll sit down, and be a

<p><i>Lady Smart.</i> [<i>to Lady Answ.</i>] Madam,
does your Ladyship never play?</p>

<p><i>Col.</i> Yes; I suppose her Ladyship
plays sometimes for an Egg at <i>Easter</i>.</p>

<p><i>Neverout.</i> Ay; and a Kiss at <i>Christmas</i>.</p>

<p><i>Lady Answ.</i> Come, Mr. <i>Neverout</i>;

<p><span class="smcap"><a href="#Page_5">Page 5</a></span>, l. 1. 1695.—This date, and the previous
“more than forty years past,” are of course
adjusted to the date of the book’s appearance.
See Introduction for its probable chronology.</p>

<p><span class="smcap"><a href="#Page_5">Page 5</a></span>, l. 18. For “because” I am half inclined
to read “became”—a very likely misprint.</p>

<p><span class="smcap"><a href="#Page_6">Page 6</a></span>, ll. 4-10. “<i>Twelve ... Sixteen.</i>”—This
would bring us to 1723, which may or
may not mark the date of a version of the
“Conversation.” The first “Twelve” would
almost exactly coincide with the “Essay on
Conversation” referred to above.</p>

<p><span class="smcap"><a href="#Page_12">Page 12</a></span>, l. 18. “<i>Isaac the Dancing-Master.</i>”—Called
by Steele in “Tatler,” No. 34, “my
namesake Isaac.” He is best known by Soame
Jenyns’ couplet:—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">“And Isaac’s rigadoon shall live as long</div>
<div class="verse">As Raphael’s painting or as Virgil’s song.”</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>He was, as became his profession, a Frenchman.
Southey refers to him in “The Doctor.”</p>

<p><span class="smcap"><a href="#Page_16">Page 16</a></span>, l. 6. “<i>Comedies and other fantastick
Writings.</i>”—Where they will be found, as
the ingenious Mr. Wagstaff says, “strewed here
and there.”</p>

<p><span class="smcap"><a href="#Page_16">Pages 16, 17.</a></span>—“<i>Graham. D. of R. E. of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span>
E. Lord and Lady H.</i>”—I do not know that
attempts at identifying these shadowy personages
would be very wise. But the date assigned
to the Colonel is one of the marks of
long incubation. “Towards the end” of Charles
II.’s reign would be about 1684. A fine gentleman
of that day might very well have been
Mr. Wagstaff’s “companion” had the latter
written in 1710—less well had he written a
quarter of a century later.</p>

<p><span class="smcap"><a href="#Page_18">Page 18</a></span>, l. 24.—Swift, like a good Tory and
Churchman, never forgave Burnet.</p>

<p><span class="smcap"><a href="#Page_21">Page 21</a></span>, l. 2. “<i>Selling of Bargains</i>” is the
returning of a coarse answer to a question or
other remark. So in Dorset’s charming poem
about “This Bess of my heart, this Bess of my
soul.”</p>

<p><span class="smcap"><a href="#Page_24">Page 24</a></span>, l. 26. “<i>Great Ornaments of Style</i>,”
or, as it hath been put otherwise, “<i>a grand set-off
to conversation</i>.”—Observe that in these passages
as to Free-Thinking and Oaths, Swift
maintains his invariable attitude as to profanity.</p>

<p><span class="smcap"><a href="#Page_25">Page 25</a></span>, last line. “<i>Poet.</i>”—I know him not, if
he ever existed save as a maggot of Swift’s brain.</p>

<p><span class="smcap"><a href="#Page_26">Page 26</a></span>, l. 13. “<i>Sir John Perrot.</i>”—Deputy
of Ireland and a stout soldier, but an unlucky
politician. He died in the Tower, where he is
not unlikely to have had leisure and reason to
perfect himself in commination.</p>

<p><span class="smcap"><a href="#Page_31">Page 31</a></span>, l. 16. “<i>Lilly.</i>”—The Latin grammarian,
of course, not the astrologer.</p>

<p><span class="smcap"><a href="#Page_32">Page 32</a></span>, l. 12. “<i>e’n’t</i>” I presume to be identical
with <i>ain’t</i>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap"><a href="#Page_36">Page 36</a></span>, l. 21. It may seem strange that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span>
Mr. Wagstaff, who loves not books and scholars,
should refer to a grave philosopher. But fine
gentlemen in his youth had to know or seem to
know their Hobbes.</p>

<p><span class="smcap"><a href="#Page_38">Page 38</a></span>, l. 26. “<i>Please.</i>”—<i>sic</i> in orig.</p>

<p><span class="smcap"><a href="#Page_41">Page 41</a>.</span>—In this page Swift strikes in with
his friends against the “dunces.” One may
suspect that Tom Brown was in the first
draught, and perhaps Dennis, Ward and Gildon
being added later.</p>

<p><span class="smcap"><a href="#Page_42">Page 42</a></span>, l. 6.—Ozell, the translator of Rabelais.
Stevens I do not know or have forgotten,
and the “Dunciad” knows him not.</p>

<p><span class="smcap"><a href="#Page_44">Page 44</a></span>, l. 26. “<i>The Craftsman.</i>”—This must
be one of the latest additions, the “Craftsman”
being the organ of Pulteney and the Opposition
in the great Walpolian battle.</p>

<p><span class="smcap"><a href="#Page_46">Page 46</a></span>, ll. 11, 17. “<i>Another for Alexander!</i>”</p>

<p><span class="smcap"><a href="#Page_50">Page 50</a></span>, l. 21. “<i>Those of Sir Isaac.</i>”—Mr.
Craik and others have noticed that Swift’s
grammar, especially in unrevised pieces, is not
always impeccable. But this, like other things
in this Introduction, is clearly writ in character,
the character of the more polite than pedantic
Wagstaff.</p>

<p><span class="smcap"><a href="#Page_56">Page 56</a></span>, l. 26. “<i>Wit at Will.</i>”—Readers of
the minor and even of the greater writers of the
late sixteenth and early seventeenth centuries
will remember the interminable jingles and
plays on these two words wherever they could
be introduced. The phrase “Wit at will”
survived most of its companions as a catchword.</p>

<p><span class="smcap"><a href="#Page_58">Page 58</a></span>, l. 3. “<i>Queen Elizabeth’s dead.</i>”—A<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span>
minute philosopher might be pleased with the
inquiry when Queen Anne superseded her gracious
predecessor in this phrase. Naturally that
time had not come when the “Conversation”
was first planned.</p>

<p><span class="smcap"><a href="#Page_59">Page 59</a></span>, l. 2. “<i>Push-pin.</i>”—Allusions to this
old children’s game are very common in the
seventeenth century; rare, I think, in the
eighteenth.</p>

<p><span class="smcap"><a href="#Page_64">Page 64</a></span>, l. 20. “<i>Vardi.</i>”—See Introduction,
p. 32, where the form is “Verdi.”</p>

<p><span class="smcap"><a href="#Page_65">Page 65</a></span>, l. 28. “<i>Lob’s pound</i>” means an inextricable
difficulty. In Dekker’s paraphrase of
the “Quinze Joyes du Mariage,” it is used to
render the French <i>dans la nasse</i>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap"><a href="#Page_72">Page 72</a></span>, l. 1. I do not understand “<i>Map-sticks</i>.”</p>

<p><span class="smcap"><a href="#Page_76">Page 76</a></span>, ll. 3, 4. “<i>Cooking.</i>”—<i>I.e.</i> (as I suppose),
putting the bread-and-butter in the tea.
I believe this atrocious practice is not absolutely
obsolete yet.</p>

<p><span class="smcap"><a href="#Page_76">Page 76</a></span>, last line but one. “<i>Head for the
washing.</i>”—I think this is quite dead in English;
<i>laver la tête</i> is of course still excellent French for
to scold or rate.</p>

<p><span class="smcap"><a href="#Page_79">Page 79</a></span>, l. 3. “<i>A Lord.</i>”—Lord Grimstone,
whose production made the wits merry for a
long time. He is Pope’s “booby Lord,” and
this absurd play (which, however, he is said to
have written at the age of 13), was reprinted in
his despite by the Duchess of Marlborough,
with whom he had an election quarrel. <i>Lady
Sparkish</i> is in orig., but is probably a slip for
Lady Answerall.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap"><a href="#Page_82">Page 82</a></span>, l. 23. “<i>The Lord of the Lord knows
what.</i>”—A peerage revived with slightly altered
title by Peter Simple’s shipmates in favour of
“the Lord Nozoo.”</p>

<p><span class="smcap"><a href="#Page_103">Page 103</a></span>, l. 4. “<i>Ld. Smart.</i>”—Erratum for
“Ld. Sparkish.”</p>

<p><span class="smcap"><a href="#Page_103">Page 103</a></span>, l. 13. “<i>Tantiny Pig.</i>”—The pig
usually assigned as companion to St. Anthony.</p>

<p><span class="smcap"><a href="#Page_105">Page 105</a></span>, l. 26. “<i>Poles.</i>”—St. Paul’s.</p>

<p><span class="smcap"><a href="#Page_109">Page 109</a></span>, l. 4. “<i>Jommetry.</i>”—See Introduction.</p>

<p><span class="smcap"><a href="#Page_110">Page 110</a></span>, l. 7.—I do not know the origin of
Miss’s catchword. Julia, the heroine of Dryden’s
“Amboyna,” had used it beforehand.</p>

<p><span class="smcap"><a href="#Page_111">Page 111</a></span>, l. 25. “<i>Tansy</i>” has two senses, a
plant and a sort of custard. The reader may
choose which suits the circumstances best for
metaphorical explanation.</p>

<p><span class="smcap"><a href="#Page_112">Page 112</a></span>, l. 11. “<i>Otomy</i>,” for “anatomy,”
“skeleton.”</p>

<p><span class="smcap"><a href="#Page_114">Page 114</a></span>, l. 17. “<i>Ld. Smart</i>” again for “Ld.
Sparkish;” at the foot of the next page for “<i>Lady</i>
Smart.”</p>

<p><span class="smcap"><a href="#Page_117">Page 117</a></span>, last line. “<i>Smoke</i>,” “look at;”
later, “twig.”</p>

<p><span class="smcap"><a href="#Page_118">Page 118</a></span>, l. 13. “<i>Lady Sparkish</i>,” probably
for “Lady Smart,” as being hostess.</p>

<p><span class="smcap"><a href="#Page_121">Page 121</a></span>, last line. “<i>Inkle.</i>”—Ribbon or tape.</p>

<p><span class="smcap"><a href="#Page_129">Page 129</a></span>, l. 8. Scott has borrowed this
vigorous protest of Miss in one of his private
letters.</p>

<p><span class="smcap"><a href="#Page_131">Page 131</a></span>, l. 7. “<i>Ld. Sparkish</i>” should evidently
be “Ld. Smart.”</p>

<p><span class="smcap"><a href="#Page_135">Page 135</a></span>, l. 14. “<i>Kept a Corner for a Venison<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span>
Pasty.</i>”—Which Dr. Goldsmith remembered in
immortal verse.</p>

<p><span class="smcap"><a href="#Page_140">Page 140</a></span>, l. 12. I do not know whether this
speech was meant for Lord Sparkish or Lady
Answerall.</p>

<p><span class="smcap"><a href="#Page_143">Page 143</a></span>, ll. 1, 3. An unnecessary double
entry, but right in the attribution.</p>

<p><span class="smcap"><a href="#Page_145">Page 145</a></span>, l. 9. “<i>In my Tip</i>,” “as I am
drinking.”</p>

<p><span class="smcap"><a href="#Page_161">Page 161</a></span>, l. 4. “<i>Weily rosten</i>,” should probably
be “<i>b</i>rosten,” <i>i.e.</i>, “well-nigh burst.”</p>

<p><span class="smcap"><a href="#Page_162">Page 162</a></span>, l. 9. Lord Smart might make this
speech; but from the answer it would seem to
be his Lady’s.</p>

<p><span class="smcap"><a href="#Page_165">Page 165</a></span>, l. 13.—I don’t know whether Swift,
who never forgot his feud with “Cousin Dryden,”
was indulging in a half-gird at “The corruption
of a poet is the generation of a critic.”</p>

<p><span class="smcap"><a href="#Page_176">Page 176</a></span>, l. 8. “<i>Concealer.</i>”—A brilliant pun
on “Counsellor.”</p>

<p><span class="smcap"><a href="#Page_181">Page 181</a></span>, l. 24. “<i>A Bone in my Leg.</i>”—This
odd phrase for a peculiar cramp in the leg is
not dead yet.</p>

<p><span class="smcap"><a href="#Page_183">Page 183</a></span>, l. 21. “<i>Quare.</i>”—David Q., died
in 1724. He had invented repeaters, and
throughout the eighteenth century was what
Tompion was later among watchmakers, what
Joe Manton was long among gunmakers, a
name to conjure with and to quote.</p>

<p><span class="smcap"><a href="#Page_184">Page 184</a></span>, l. 24. “<i>Box it about; ’twill
come to my Father.</i>”—The famous Jacobite cant-phrase
for breeding disturbance in hopes of a
fresh Revolution.</p>
